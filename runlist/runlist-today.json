    "text": "CBum ? Full Day of Eating (Off?Season) ? Transcript \nCompiled on 2025-11-01 \nwhat is up YouTube it's been a minute \nsince I've been in my kitchen so we are \nback doing another full day of eating \nthis off season the last time I checked \nin I think \nI cannot remember but I think of around \n240 ish pounds the last little David did \nI just weighed myself right now of 255 \npounds and it's a true weight of a \nlittle bit more the last few days \nbecause I was like eat a little bit it \nwas a little bloated holding on some \nwater but I got a massage and just \nflushed it all out so today I was 255 \npounds a month like 15 pounds from \nwhatever still got like \n10 months until the Olympia and last \nyear my biggest weight was like 264. so \n10 more pounds and I'll be the biggest \nI've ever been but to the food because \nI'm hungry and a little bit late so \ntypically I've still been doing pancakes \nalmost every morning but two times a \nweek I have this concoction right here \nat this shake I'm about to show you but \nright now I dropped Courtney off at the \nairport like 5 a.m came back fell back\nPage 1 \nasleep and I just don't feel like making pancakes right now so it's gonna be the shake today it's super simple nothing crazy literally just blending up protein oats and some almond butter and then with that I eat a bagel I could do more oats in the shake technically but if you put like 120 grams of oats in a shake and drink it it just tastes like you're drinking sand and it's not that good but you can get away it was like 60 to 70. and the trick that I like to do is if \nyou put ice or even better if you put fruit I just didn't really feel like \nhaving a fruit smoothie do you put fruit or ice or something that's gonna add maybe slight texture to it you're less likely to feel the oats we're right in front of me you're less likely to feel the oats in the drink and it'll be \neasier to get them \nso I have 70 72 grams of Oats I do two scoops of protein \nI typically either go with chocolate or cookies and cream for this shake going with cookies and cream today to do a scoop of fiber \nif I do one scoop of five or the total fiber and this is seven grams and I'm also getting a good amount from The Oaks so beautiful way to start the day with\nPage 2 \nabove the fiber go to the bathroom nice and well and then I add in I'm almost out of almond butter this is like the scraps \nif you look in our cupboard over in the corner where we keep our almond butter we probably have I don't know at least 10 at this point almond butters that look like this because corny I mean worse than this corny only likes it when they're like Smooth at the top and you can like drizzle it onto her food so when it gets some of this little scraps she leaves it and I just usually use it for shakes so it doesn't go to waste but that's how we eat on butter in this house I usually do 15 grams that's 19. so bonus four grams today 19 grams of almond butter and then I'm going to blend this up \nand I'm going to toast the bagel and I'm going to put on some ghee butter you can eat grass-fred butter as well this is grass-fed clarified ghee butter which means they've taken the lactose out of it and put it through a process to try and kind of get rid of some of the [ __ ] in it so it's supposed to be a little healthier but I don't know it makes I like enjoy it better it has a little bit of a different taste to it this one also\nPage 3 \nhas added pink Himalayan salt to it so it tastes even better \nall right so quick and easy breakfast I literally think I made that in like 11 minutes so if you ever want to get out the door and get in a [ __ ] I mean I haven't eaten yet but if you want to get out the door quick get them a bunch of calories this is a good way to do it also I've been taking \nthis glucose product twice a day once with breakfast and once when I have like a pasta meal post workout or something or if I'm not trading that day and I don't have that huge meal I probably won't have it you can also buy berberine Crow meat chromium and a bunch of stuff like that separately and put it together but this is like a stacked formula like a bunch of vitamins chromium berberine as well as cinnamon extract a bunch of other stuff in it as well to help you kind of digest and shuttle carbs where you want them to be so it just helps in the off season if you're eating a lot of carbs but aside from that this is \nbreakfast I got two scoops of protein 70 grams of Oats 19 grams of almond butter I got one and a half Bagels covered in ghee butter and I think that's all \nthat's in here so this whole thing super\nPage 4 \neasy to eat is 1 \n344 calories so great way to mash down in the morning break that fast and try and get huge \nall right huh don't eat it every day my bagels are damn good when you do get to eat them I also wanted to mention that I am going to be at the Arnold this year it's in like two weeks I believe so a bunch of people have been asking me if I'm going to be there I will be there I'm going to be not with a sponsor I have a bunch of stuff going on Dom's going down there for a bunch of meetings I have to join him for a few meetings so I'll be busy but I'm just going down there to try and meet you guys meet a bunch of you guys there's going to be an option if you want to pay to get a VIP ticket to come and see \npeople such as myself Jay Cutler Ronnie Coleman big Ramy I think a bunch of people like that are gonna have like the options where you can guarantee to see them and then those people are going to be sifted through first in the line so that they're guaranteed their spot to see someone because honestly the last few events I've gone to people waited like hours and didn't even get a chance to see me or whoever they were waiting\nPage 5 \nfor and that just sucks and I don't want to waste anyone's time or \nhow to upset a new one so this will be the option and then after we'll cycle through a normal line but I can't \nguarantee I see someone all the time so if I can't I truly am sorry we are \ntrying to do our best to appease \neveryone in the way that they get to get what they want at these events but they're always crazy they're always hectic I think the website does say something about paying for a sign something or other but if you guys bring anything to me I'm not gonna make you pay for it just be polite be nice be like hey man can you please sign this and I'll sign it should try to have a marker ready or something like that on you so if you show up with a piece of paper and a marker \nand nice and you're nice you want me to sign something I always will I won't say no just come up say what's up have a chat get a picture I'll sign whatever you guys want and yeah we'll have a good time it's gonna be a crazy weekend these weekends honestly kind of give me anxiety because like \nI have to go somewhere and like talk to people for six hours and get in line\nPage 6 \nwith your love but then even getting there takes me like three hours because I can't walk there I can't work out on these weekends at all because I go to a gym and it's just people asking me to stop being chatting with you there so it's a lot of work it's a [ __ ] show but I am grateful for the opportunity to get to meet a lot of you guys so if you are there then hopefully be at the meet say what's up and have a good time but I'm gonna put this down get out of here and see you guys again for meal number two all right meal number two getting real creative get a real good at cooking this time eating this \nprobably should be showing that instead but so I told you guys my last video I ordered mega fit meals I don't eat all my meals from this but they're just it's easy to get a bunch like this in a week this one is seven ounces of certified Black Angus steak and two cups of rice so I don't know how accurate the reading is on here but it says 890 calories for this meal so not a bad way to get in a meal but I'm gonna throw this in a glass dish so I'm not warm enough plastic all the time and gonna Heat this up and then an apartment this morning that I had to run to so I'm\nPage 7 \ngonna run into work eat the next meal after that and we're gonna head to the gym I think and train back but I'm not filming that workout because it's full day of eating not a workout video but yeah cheat code \nmeal prep even if you have like six or seven that you order a week it's not it's realistically it's cheaper than \neating Chipotle and if you just have one a day on that meal that you're like oh I don't have a meal right now I'm not prepared I'm running at the door it's a lunch at work or something and that meal is a pre-made healthy meal high protein whatever you're gonna be better off than ordering [ __ ] Chick-fil-A or \nsomething even though Chick-fil-A is amazing but yeah it's just a little helpful tip all right so this is meal number three prison my pre-workout meal typical day it goes breakfast then I come in the office and I usually eat meal number two but I was a little late today so I ate that home and then I have this at like four o'clock go to the gym at like five but I have the what's in here with me today because Courtney is on a trip and me and the Watson are having some father's daughter bonding time so it's just me and her for a while\nPage 8 \nwe're gonna have some crazy parties have fun so it's gonna be good but meal number three is six ounces of chicken and two cups of rice so similar to my last meal but chicken instead of beef I like to have chicken rice before the gym usually because it's your most basic meal ever and it's just easy to digest mega fit says this is 760 calories in here so I'm hoping that's right but I'm gonna put this down \nprobably put some hot buffalo sauce on it just for a little bit of flavor a \nlittle bit of kick it's a little spicy \nthan I would have liked but it still tastes amazing I'm gonna eat this throw down some pre-workout probably some repeat because it's a goat flavor and then I'm gonna head to the gym and I'll see you guys after the gym for my post workout meal whatever the hell it's gonna be \nall right so post workout meal this is another trade secret \nI learned this on accident because I was eating sweet potato on prep and I was like why the [ __ ] is it like this much sweet potato for the amount of calories they should be eating so I stopped baking it but if you bake or air fry sweet potato the volume of it becomes\nPage 9 \nlike a tenth of what it is \nbefore cooking it I'm not really making much much sense right now I'm starving pretty much showing prep I boil my sweet potatoes so it's like a little more voluminous but if you cut up the sweet potato into like nice little bits like this almost like little fries \nand then you cover it in oil on the pan more calories as well and then you bake the [ __ ] out of it for like an hour to the point where I like where some of them get burnt like some of them literally turn black and you have to throw those out and the rest are like a little crispy but just cooked it shrinks them down a lot \nit makes them way easier to eat so in this bowl I have 500 grams of raw white sweet potato which was like a full Bowl it wasn't that much but it was a good sad bowl and it shrunk down to literally nothing in here and I also have 165 grams of ground turkey I also ate a banana while I was waiting for that to heat up because I was starving when I got home \nbut like I was saying super easy to eat this is what I normally would have pasta but I don't really want to have pasta at the moment and for those that always\nPage 10 \ncall me up I say pasta the correct way you say pasta the wrong way so don't don't even say that again \nbut this meal comes up to 779 calories with \nthe banana so not a huge meal but still like I said getting 500 grams of potato down that easily is very helpful so another little Pro tip to bulking \ngetting more calories is baked the sugar sweet potato so it shrinks down cut it up and cover it into oil as well that's what gives it crispy and gives it a little more flavor so I'm gonna eat this shower and probably eat again soon because I'm hungry and it's not a huge meal so I'll catch you for a meal number five \nall right so meal number five I \ncompletely started eating this and forgot I was doing a full day beating that's how horrible of a YouTuber I am last this next meal is I blast the back of the sweet potato because it was delicious a little bit less this time I had 300 grams worth of sweet potato and the sweet potatoes weighed raw and then I just like I weigh it raw and then I weigh it cooked and then I do like the conversion so I know how much it is because it's easier to measure it raw on\nPage 11 \nmy fitness pal so 300 grams raw weight through potato 170 grams of ground beef which Courtney cooked into patties before she left and half an avocado so I have that kind of mixed up in here it's kind of like a bunless burger and sweet potato fries I don't know it's pretty good to me but this meal comes up to comes up to like 690 700 calories ish I don't know my math isn't so hot but I'm getting in some fats later in the day post workout I didn't have a bunch of fat because you just want to get some carbs in at that point and I saw your digestion at all not that it's like that crucial because of eating so close to metal coat anyways but that's just my method of doing things I like having fat before bed too so it keeps me sustained longer after this I'm probably gonna throw down like a shake or something I normally have two shakes a day and I'm probably gonna finish today with one of those so I'm gonna eat this finish this Connie episode and I'll catch you guys for the final snack all right so meal number six if you go on a call it a meal we are back right where we started with another Shake I have 80 grams of oats in there taking this GI product before bed and revive and I also\nPage 12 \nthrow glutamine in here every night glutamine does help with recovery but it's also really good for your gut so take a little gut health thing at night to make sure I'm eating all this food and it's actually being absorbed and digested properly \nthen I'm going to have a single scoop of chocolate protein because who doesn't not love \nto not love who doesn't love chocolate milk before bed just it's a goat and it's like a rich dark chocolate so gotta love it and then finally I have \n30 grams 32 grams whatever how close it gets of almond butter which is \nequivalent to two tablespoons I already won and \nLucas Boom for good luck everybody just doesn't get a little \none of those things it's always \ndelicious \nalways pulls through some people are afraid to drink their calories and I'm not gonna lie I am that person \nI just have this like innate belief in me that real food is better which it is I believe it is but \nI'm getting enough real food in the day I'm positive of that I have enough real food so that if I have a shake in the\nPage 13 \nmorning and at night or whatever and in between I'm getting all the food I need then I'm good to go and I'm not really going to stress it \nand haven't been the biggest eater lately so these are some things that kind of help me get stuff in \nthe number one tips I always say when you're bulking I mean people either struggling with dieting or struggling with bulking currently I'm struggling with bulking but digestion \nabsolutely crucial first thing to help digestion to drink a [ __ ] ton of water drink a lot of water don't like kill yourself but drink a lot of water it takes off like glutamine GI from revive you can take digestive supplements if you're eating like really huge meals but really you want to be eating types of foods that your body like enjoys like reacts will digest well so that you don't need a digestive take stuff like berberine and stuff like the glucose product revive has those can also help you well shuttle your carbs so it kind of helps your insulin and your appetite stays where it needs to be doing cardio helps a lot I started doing cardio about four times a week right now I have an actual road bike outside that I ride my\nPage 14 \nbike while sometimes people might think it's counterintuitive to do cardio on a bulk when you're trying to gain weight it's not at all the it helps your \ncardiovascular health which you absolutely need when you're putting away on top of that it does help you like able to eat more so pretty much focus on energy output as well as digestion and you should be good to go just eat food you enjoy and worst case scenarios blend some oats in a shake and it's an easy way to get some food down trust me you can take into your workout carbs eat lots of fats I don't even eat a lot of fats today and I still have my calories so I'm doing pretty good I often have uh pasta throughout the day you guys have seen but today I'll do hidden sweet potatoes for my carbs after the gym find things that are calorically dense that you just enjoy to eat for me it's pasta just easy to eat or sweet potato and they just go down like it's nothing but to get to the end of this video my total calories of the day are 5 145 calories so I'm right now I'm probably trying to aim around 4 800 to 5 000 I'm over it today awesome better but I'm not too worried about being very specific with my calories I change up\nPage 15 \nwhat I eat but typically breakfast is either the shake or pancakes and then I always have two mega fit meals during the day the same meals I showed you and then throw the sweet potato or past that night so there's really only two options I have in there but I'm very consistent and I don't really care if I'm within like 10 of my gold and I'm usually pretty good \nthe the macros are going to be a little bit skewed on this because of the mega fit meals but it's somewhere around 500 carbs 140 grams of fat and 265 grams of protein \nit's a pretty good right on point there a lot of bodybuilders when they get to a certain point of eating a lot of \nfood they try and add a little more protein to get their calories in because it kind of makes a little bit more \nsluggish when you're eating a [ __ ] ton of carbs makes you tired sleep all the time if you know Ian he literally just sleeps all the time because he is eating more than me and either way bigger than me so one thing they can do is eat more protein but because of my autoimmune my kidneys and stuff I try and focus on not getting a crazy amount of protein I stick around a pound per body weight at\nPage 16 \nmy bowl which I'm right around I'm a little over today I'm sure that's higher than it should have been higher than it says on my fitness pal but that's okay I'll survive we're not it's only eating like 400 grams of protein but for the average person it's okay if you do that so \nyeah I mean there's not many secrets to bulking other than eating a lot unless you're someone who gains fat too easily then you got to take it a lot slower but if you're someone who's skinny and hard gaining and you're like how do I get big you just got to eat more listen your body eat more follow the scale look at your body fat you don't want to be getting fat in your off season you do not need to be fat so just \nbe consistent I'm rambling because I'm really tired right now and this is like one of those things we've talked too much when you're tired \nalso here in chip \nI'm alone this is my first time sleeping in this new house alone \nso I'm probably gonna it's probably haunted and they're gonna go through gonna come and kill me tonight because I'm alone usually how it works but anyways I'm gonna put this shake down 5\nPage 17 \n000 calories will be in my belly hopefully getting huge 255 pounds road to 265. it's a goal for the end of both so I will keep you guys along the way thank you guys for watching and I'll catch you in the next one\nPage 18 "

    "text": "Upper Body Training ? Video Transcript \nSource: User-provided transcript \nPrepared on 2025-10-26 \nNotes \nThis transcript was lightly cleaned and formatted. Short, slogan-like lines were treated as headings where appropriate.\nWhat is up, YouTube? Just stopped by the warehouse because we got a new flavor. Couple new flavors coming out of stuff. Watermelon grape pump. Absolutely fire. We do not have enough pump flavors and I've been pushing for these. So, I'm very excited to finally get this and training upper body today. So, I'm fired up about that. Quick update on my training. Right now I'm in I don't know what phase 572 or some [beep] of this rehab, but we're coming out on the other end and I have a phase of hypertrophy coming up in the next week. So today's a pretty predominantly hypertrophy day. Got some stained in the background. Spotify has been finding my jams from the AI system. But um yeah, my next phase of programming is a lot more hypertrophy based, which I am fired up about. I have like a chest and back day and then an arm and shoulder day and then a quad day and a hamstring day. Two on, one off. Upper, lower, rest, upper, lower. So, I'm fired up about that. I feel like I've been lacking a lot of drive in the gym. And I texted Justin about this and I'm like, \"Yo, is my training going to be like this forever?\" Because I'm like ready to lose my [beep] cuz I'm going in the gym and doing like isometric hold split lunges and glute bridges and [beep] rotator cuffs for sets of 30 times six sets. And I was just sick of it to be completely honest, you know. And I was listening to this thing talking about like the only way you see progress in life is through discomfort. And I'm so used to the discomfort being Sorry, that was annoying. The discomfort being training hard and intensity and like pushing through hard training and hard dieting and all these things. And the discomfort that I've been experiencing was just doing the boring little easy [beep] that I did not want to do. And it was for me discomfort because I was [beep] bored and didn't want to do it. But it was what I needed for the progress. My body needed to heal my shoulder. But I'm kind of over that [beep] So, I'm ready to train [beep] hard again and get jack and put some muscle back on because I've gotten to be way too much of a skinny [beep] I'm actually not that skinny yet, but it's coming there. I actually busted a tank top today. It's like 110? here in Florida and I still have no air conditioning in my gym. So, with that being said, I'm going to get the [beep] out of here. I'm gonna drink this on the way to the gym and then I'll see you guys there for a little bit of I mean it's kind of full upper body minus there's no specific delt movement but I'm going to be moving up the weight doing what I do trying to get a nice little pump. All right. So, last week's gym quote was sweat the small stuff because we are beautifully obsessed with doing something. People think it's bad to be obsessed, but we love to be obsessed with the gym. So, we sweat small stuff, every little detail. This week, you're not going to be able to read this at all. My marker died. Now, I can't have a cool whiteboard anymore. Horrible writing, so don't judge me. I don't even know if I know how to spell this. Consistent discomfort equals discomfort. Gross. Holy [beep] I am if dyslexic today. Consistent discomfort equals consistent growth. I don't even know if I still said that right. Pretty much what I'm talking about in the car is what I was thinking about. It's like being in a state of consistent discomfort means that you are consistently growing in some capacity and getting better. And even if you think deeper on that, if you are in a state of consistent discomfort, it means you're consistently changing. Because if you do the same thing consistently, what used to be discomfort then becomes comfort because your body gets used to it. Things that used to be hard now becomes easy or feel easier. So less discomfort means less growth. You have to continuously adapt, continue to evolve and find ways to get better and change and fine-tune your goals and what you're doing and everything like that. So like the discomfort I was having before was just like coming in the gym consistently, not wanting to do the things, but knowing it with what I needed to do to progress. And then it got to a point where I was like, \"Okay, you're kind of losing the progress that you were getting from this. The shoulders good enough now. Now it's time to get in the gym and actually start training hard again and getting into this discomfort of intensity and training hard and pushing things and learning how to do that again with my body.\" And I think the most distinct place that you see this in results is dieting. People who cannot lose weight, who can't get lean, if you're not hungry, if you're\nnot uncomfortable, you're not going to lose weight. It's like switching your perception of that hunger is bad cuz like we're hardwired to think hunger means we need to eat. But to switch it, be like, \"Well, my goal is to get lean or my goal is to lose body fat or lose weight.\" To sit in that discomfort and to actually be like, \"I'm hungry. It feels uncomfortable.\" That will lead to consistent growth or consistent fat loss. Opposite of growth technically, but growth towards your goal. So, this is the the theme of the week. Step into discomfort. And it's absolutely [beep] applicable to everything in life. What I remember mostly for I really experienced this was in 2022 when I first started working with Hani. I was going through a lot of changes in my life and I still sucked at public speaking and it's something I wanted to get good at. So I just threw myself into consistent discomfort. I put myself into like talks, Q&As;'s. I'd go to events and be like I'll talk in front of a crowd. I agreed to seminars. I did all these things that I did not want to do. And I was so uncomfortable doing all those things. I got anxious before every single time. I was worried. But it made me better and better at it. made me grow in the terms of my skill as a public speaker, but also that confidence led into everywhere else in my life. So being able to seek out discomfort, I think, is so important because if you don't seek it and get the growth that you want, life is going to throw you into discomfort regardless. It's just not going to be by choice, you're going to become a little victim, little [beep] and be complaining about it and not be where you want to be. So, you might as well go find it and build the life you actually want. So, that's my rant for this beautiful Sunday morning. Let's try and get Jack. All right, I might have been a little ahead of myself on being excited for this workout. I checked my program and it's not fully fun yet, but next week part of my program is chest workout of choice, back workout choice. So, I've been kind of like doing specific things to protect my body, but I'm getting that itch to just like be creative in my workout and kind of do something different than just the specific movements that don't harm me. So, I'm close enough now where to my program specifically to lean towards doing what I want to see like every every now and often you got to just scratch an itch that you really want to do, but also kind of experiment in new movements. See what affects my shoulder, what imbalances I have in certain positions, certain movements. My left arm is much weaker than the right arm because it's still recovering or I can't even do the range of motion or whatever it may be. So, this week is still perfect form of stuff I know I can't properly do. Ramping up intensity every week. Next week is fun stuff. All right, so this is the moment where I should have the 5 lb increments in my weights, but I used to be young and reckless and only give a [beep] about jumping 10 to 20 lbs. And now I probably wish I had more, but 70s last week I don't have 75. So going to go for the 80 this week. Probably going to feel a little bit heavy. [beep] it. It's a goal. So that's all I got to say. Wish me luck. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. \nThink \nI actually got 13 instead of 12. I can't count. When I'm trying to do a three, one, one, one tempo. All I know is I'm trying to control the weight down. Slight pause at the bottom of the rep so I'm not getting any momentum out of it. A, protect my shoulder. B, strengthen my shoulder in each part of that lengthen position. Control the weight the whole way. Feel good. Last week 70s felt exactly like that. This is the beauty of having muscle maturity coming off an injury. but I can bounce back real quick. So, if I can keep my form this clean, keep progressing, have some crispy form, these 150 lb dumbbells. It's been a while since I moved those. It's been a long time. Long time coming. All right, back row X, whatever. Star Trek M machine semi pronated grip, semi neutral grip. Doesn't really [beep] matter. I'm just trying to move heavier weight than I did last week essentially. But it is what it is.\n[Applause] \nHeat. Heat. So felt good. Heat. Heat. Yeah. Heat. knock. \n[Applause] \nIt is crazy how much just lifting a little hardy hardy harder boosts my mood compared to just like fine-tuning form and everything like that. It's a necessity. But my life has switched so much since being just a bodybuilder, being a father now being my priority, having the businesses that are growing so fast, pulling me in so many directions. On top of that, the media outlets, the documentary, all the things like I'm a [beep] bodybuilder and I'll have like eight things on my calendar throughout the day and I'm like brain dead after that [beep] Like my mind is not built for that kind of life. I like creativity stuff, creative stuff. I like training hard, doing hard [beep] I don't like the nuances of business nearly so much. I've dabbled in a lot now, so at least I can learn where I like and wherever I enjoy the most, I put the most energy and I reap the most rewards. So, it's an important learning lesson for me. But just having my life switched to having so much stuff keeping my mind busy in ways that I don't fully love and then not having training to like balance it out to get in the gym and just like decompress all that and feel good. It's been like a it's been a not I mean a challenge, I guess. I just haven't felt like myself fully. when I come in the gym and I can like lift hard and I'm I'm still not going crazy intense but like this is a higher intensity than I've lifted in like six months from my injury especially for upper body to be able to just push a little bit of weight like that to be moving up weights seeing like the progressive overload coming just feels good just like you had a shitty day who the [beep] cares you're lifting weights you're stronger than you were last week it's a beautiful day got nothing to complain about it's kind of incredible how great the gym is there's so much of my life that has been evolved from working out like my confidence my anxiety, my mental peace, everything. So much that I've learned from my life and so much that I've like used to get through the hard times that comes from the gym. And I'm just so grateful for that. And that's why I try and kind of share a lot of like mental mindset shift because doing hard stuff is what causes your brain to learn that thing. And the gym is such a beautiful thing where you can consciously choose to do it and pull what you want from it and just have such a positive outlet where you're intentionally putting yourself into doing something hard where you can see results, build confidence, and use that confidence in other areas of your life. Turned into a tangent here, but just feels good to lift some heavy weight again. I almost said heavy ass weight, but I'm not quite there yet. Heavier weight. One of these days I'll be back at the heavy ass weight and we'll be rocking and rolling. Heat. Heat. \n[Music] \nHeat. \n[Music] \nHeat. \n[Music] \nHeat. \n[Music] \nHeat.\n[Music] \nHeat. Heat. \n[Music] \n[Music] \n[Music] \nMan, this one still gets the best of me. This is one where if you guys have not felt your arms hurt in a while, just throw this in there. A little bit extra volume. Cook your arms real quick. Little bit of variable muscle action. Same thing I did last week. Super set here. I have the proper machine I'm supposed to be doing on this time for put back grips. Increase that propriception. Make sure the right muscles are moving. But essentially, I'm doing 10 reps controlled negative controlled contraction 10 times. Pause in the middle for 10 seconds and then go again. Still trying to control the negative, but I'm really just kind of trying to get through 10 reps at this point to be completely honest. So, both things are exactly like that. 10 10 second pause 10. Feel like my biceps are ripping off my arm better than this. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. That's a sign that that was too heavy for this specific exercise. [beep] it. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. It's incredible what a little bit of a pumpkin do. might fade in about 30 seconds, but looks like I put on 20 pounds. Hey Siri, how many weeks until the Olympia? Just kidding. Maybe, maybe not. Open round two for the Olympia. All right, so that's a wrap on today's workout. Getting on to the fun stuff next week. Like I said, more and more hypertrophy, more and more jack, push myself more and more. But I was talking about discomfort because I realized like in the beginning of this year especially and just post retirement I was just like giving myself a lot of giving myself a lot of easy comfort and it made me feel like shitty. It it kind of increased my anxiety. It increased my stress. I was feeling more overwhelmed by little things in my life that I don't have control over because there's obviously the [beep] that comes in your life that you can't control but then there's so much that you can control and I wasn't actively in control of those things. So then the other side of my uncontrollable things was causing a lot more stress in me and it was stupid little things. It was like not waking up when I told myself I was going to wake up but wasn't doing cardio when I was going to do cardio. I couldn't train hard because of my injury and then I I wasn't dieting anymore. I didn't have this Olympic goal so I wasn't really eating on track. If I went to the pantry and there was a cookie I wanted there and I just eaten an hour ago. I'm like [beep] it. I'm going to eat the cookie. And I did that for a while and it just like made me feel worse about myself. It was so strange to have more freedom. Made me feel more like [beep] trapped and anxious. And I think it's a very common theme amongst a lot of people right now. I think we're at an unfair advantage if I want to empathize with myself in the world of how powerful like our evolutionary brains are to seek out comfort and entertainment and food and abundance. And we have so much [beep] coming at us right now. Like it's so easy just to go on your phone. You're bored for 2 seconds. Pull your phone up. No one experiences boredom anymore. You're a little bit hungry or at least you think you're hungry but you're probably just bored. go in the pantry, grab a [beep] bag of chips, and no one experiences hunger anymore. And that's why I thought like part of the reason why I love bodybuilding so much because it forced you into these things of like starvation for three months essentially. Not starvation, that's very dramatic, but you're extremely hungry for 3 months. You're absolutely focused in a gym pushing yourself past limits that you want to do. You're sore all the time. You're hurting. You're aching. And you still have to go in and do a level of work regardless of how you feel. I think pushing through that discomfort led to so much more confidence and\nfulfillment and happiness within myself and ease of anxiety cuz I'm definitely an anxious person who overthinks a lot. And the more I wasn't in control of those things, the more the anxiety started to creep into my life and I wasn't sleeping. I was getting up through the night overthinking and all this stuff. And just being able to take control of the little things like what I put in my mouth, how I'm training in the gym, when I'm waking up, little things with my health and all that stuff makes everything feel so much better. And I think if you don't put yourself into positions of discomfort, you're not going to grow to be able to handle that. And throughout my career, you know, I would put in a lot of positions where I should have like stopped or I should have taken a break or injuries or health issues or personal things going on where it would have made complete sense and everyone would have validated me if I had backed out. But because the goal was so important to me, I pushed through. And what that led wasn't just six Olympias. to finish my career as someone who can handle hard [beep] where you feel less anxious if you believe you're somebody who can handle hard things when it comes your way. And the only way you can become that someone is by going through hard things. So if you live an extremely easy life, you're doing the same habits every day, eating shitty, kind of training, not really hard, going to work at the same time, doing the same [beep] not pushing yourself to get a promotion or anything, you're just going to feel like blah. And then if [beep] life punches you in the face with some crazy [beep] you will not be prepared for it. So, I think inevitably life will present you with some extreme discomfort at one point or another. And if you haven't consciously chosen to put yourself into discomfort prior to that, you will be a lot less mentally prepared for it. There's nothing you can truly prepare for anything in life, but you can make yourself more of a resilient, level-headed, calm person in the face of adversity. And I think that's so powerful. And I don't think people realize the day-to-day ease of anxiety that leads to. You know, I meet so many people who are so stressed and anxious and don't know what to do. And it's like, just go do some hard [beep] Push yourself through some levels of discomfort. Like for me with public speaking, it's been training hard. It's been dieting. It's been fasting for 3 days or whatever it might be. Whatever things I feel like I don't want to do. I'm not a morning person. So, I've been waking up really early every day and I just [beep] hate it in the morning. But like an hour later when I'm awake, I'm like, I'm glad I did that. Tiny things doesn't have to be hard. And you work your way up to big things. like a big goal like the Olympia allows for big challenges to come in my way and a big opportunity for growth. So, I think that's just so important and it's had me actively thinking about like random hardship I could do and that's why I did that 80 hour fast cuz I was like I feel like I'm every time I'm hungry I'm eating. Can I not do that for 3 days and I did it and I felt good after. Just little challenges like that, you know? Maybe one of these days I'm going to go [beep] drop myself in the woods out of a helicopter in Alaska and go hunt some grizzly bears or something. That would be the dream. But like I said, work your way up to some crazy challenges like that. But I don't know. Maybe this is my brain going crazy cuz I'm retired and I'm seeking for something. But I don't really give a [beep] It It feels exciting. Something I want to do. I'm enjoying training hard right now and that's enough for the moment. But I just like to seek some things that lead to discomfort. You know, even the public speaking thing I haven't done in a long time and now I get anxious when I think of doing it again. So I'm like, \"All right, [beep] I should probably put myself into that position again because it's something that I'm resisting that I feel fearful of doing.\" And I really think so much confidence comes from that. And again, this is why I [beep] love the gym so much. And I want to promote [beep] everyone getting in the gym. If I had a piece of advice for any young person of what to do with their life, I'd be like, \"Go start working out. Apply the discipline to the gym. Every time you don't want to go, go. When you're tired, go. When you're sore, work harder. Like, keep pushing through those times. Be consistent.\" And the confidence you build from consistency and doing things you want to do will just apply to everything else in your life. And I think it's so crucial. I'm a huge believer in that. But with all that being said, this\nworkout is done. I'm going to go get some food. Courtney's making waffles today, so I'm going to go bucking in on that. And that's it. Thank you guys for watching."

    "text": "From Lost to Locked-In ? CBum Mindset & Arms Workout (TraTranscript compiled by the user (Gym folder) \nGenerated on 2025-10-28\nI got a DM the other day from this kid and he was asking me, not really asking me, but declaring that he felt lost. He had no direction in life. He's 20 years old. He sees me. I seem to have a clear path of where I'm headed and he doesn't know what to do. And it really got me thinking about a lot of things cuz let me be clear, when I was 20 years old, I had no idea what the [ __ ] I was doing either. But it really got me thinking about a lot of avenues of I've heard that a lot. You know, I've had a lot of conversations with people at events or DMs or whatever it may be of people saying things like this, and it's not a rare occurrence. And I feel like every generation has had their fair share of challenges. In the past, I feel like it was a little bit more physical obvious ones like war, poverty, disease, crazy [ __ ] which I know still exists in the dark world currently. But by and large, I feel like America as a whole on average, the younger generation, their problem isn't finding comfort in hard times, but in avoiding too much comfort and too much pleasure. And I feel like the odds are heavily stacked against the younger generation because I mean, first of all, there's billions and billions and billions of dollars of research going into how to make a phone, social media, anything highly, highly addictive. And we're given that giving kids those at like 8 years old. They have them in school, bring them around everywhere in their pocket. Social media is creating these like crazy role models of like do drugs, party, look cool, chase after girls, do all this [ __ ] And it's like absolutely absurd in my opinion. And I think the ability to abstain from doing the easy, pleasurable thing that's right in front of you and picture a life that you can dream of, asking yourself if a better version of yourself exists. what that version of yourself is. Picturing the plan to get there and actually starting and executing on that plan, I think is such a rare thing right now and so hard for people to stop and even think about given how much constant distraction there is in their life. And that's what made me want to ask this kid. I was like, do you believe a better version of yourself exists? And I'll get into that. But I really, this really got me thinking a lot about role models. Like the idea of a role model and thinking about how when I was young, I had everything so wrong. And I didn't really have a role model in my life helping me. Don't get me wrong, my dad was incredible, but he wasn't really like in my face on my case in my job knowing what I was doing. He was from a different generation. He wasn't close to my age or hadn't recently gone through anything I was going through. And I, full transparency, was just a dumb kid. I thought it was cool to party, to not try in school, to do drugs, to chase after girls, to do all these things. My friends literally thought it was cool to like, and it's funny cuz my brain is still kind of wired to be like, \"Yeah, it's fun.\" You know, of course it is. And people probably listen probably feel the same way, but to like think of going out and drinking and chasing after girls with no like connection or value for who the person is. To not value your education when you're sitting there doing it. To be wasting my time with an education of which I didn't even know where it was leading me cuz I didn't think about what I wanted my future to be. I was just following the path that was put in front of me. To have all these things in front of me that I didn't have someone looking at me and being like, \"Do you want to be like a better man? Do you want to be a man period?\" Because what I was doing was what boys do, you know, like playing video games and chasing after girls, thinking it's cool to do all these things rather than building meaningful relationships, working on my making myself a better, well-rounded, more educated man to be prepared for taking care of a family and being the man that a woman that I respect would want to even be with. You know, I didn't have anyone kind of in my face being like, \"What the [ __ ] do you want to do with your life? Who do you want to be with your life?\" asking me if I wanted to be exceptional. \nPage 2\nYou know, if you ask the average kid, do you want to be exceptional? Do you want to do something great with your life? The answer is usually yes. But their actions very rarely align with it. And I feel like I didn't have anyone. And you don't need someone. The responsibility lies within yourself ultimately always. But I do believe that like a role model could be a huge asset for pushing yourself to ask these hard questions and being like if you want to be exceptional, what you're doing right now is average or even below average. And if you want to continue to be average or below average your whole life, then continue doing this. But you need to make a serious change and start doing hard [ __ ] and letting go of the easy [ __ ] the comfortable, pleasurable [ __ ] Abstain from that to make a better version of yourself. I didn't have someone really asking me that. And it's kind of a it's kind of scary now that like social media because we don't have role models in a real life. So many people I believe and now social media is such a vast array of like who do we look up to? The one with the most followers. You're young. You get on social media. If at that time the realm you fall into it is people who are promoting gambling, sex, drugs. And I'm it sounds like trit to even say those words, but people are literally like smoking weed, promoting gambling and talking about how to get girls, how to sleep with girls casually on social media. And I really think as a whole, all those things hurt men more than they benefit them. It doesn't make you cool. It just kind of takes away from values, genuine real values in life. So essentially trying not to ramble too much. This kid asked me that question in the many times I've been asked. It really got me just thinking about wanting to share that when I was young I had no idea what the [ __ ] I was doing and I didn't have a role model and falling into the wrong role model can get yourself into a bad position. But someone being able to ask you what do you want with your life? Do you believe a better version of yourself exists? And take responsibility to take that in action. And the reason that question to ask yourself is do you believe a better version of yourself exists? Is because if you say yes, you are admitting that you have faith. You have faith that a better version of yourself exists. And the only way to move forward in life is by starting and just taking action. There's no book or 12step program or perfect way that it's going to organize things. And this sounds super trait to say. I know everyone knows that, but people still don't do it. Awareness doesn't mean anything. Action is all that matters. But what do you need for action? Sometimes people like, \"What do I need for action?\" Well, you need faith. And if you believe a better version of yourself exists, then you already have faith. So, as a young man, speaking to most young men, you need to have faith a better version of yourself exists. You need to take responsibility for your own life into your own hands. Most likely, you're not going to have a role model following you, telling you what to do, asking you these hard questions, and pushing in the right direction. You need to be the one to do that. So, where the [ __ ] do you start? easiest thing to do. Look in your life. See the things that are easy that everybody is doing. What's what in your life is like calls towards you that you can just feel as a vice when you're checking your phone all the time, playing video games, eating shitty food, doing all things. What calls to you that makes you want to do that everyone else is also called to and avoid those things. And just by avoiding those things, you are already going to be ahead of everyone else who's stuck into those things. And then being able to sit down and clearly define the values that are important to you. You can start with like an ideal person that you want to be defining those values. Actually think about that strictly. Like if you say you're going to do something, do it. Be a man of your word. You're not going to succumb to the easy pleasures. You're going to value delayed gratification over easy gratification. You're \nPage 3\ngoing to be respect every single person that you meet. You're not going to lie. You're not going to [ __ ] You're going to work hard. If you're going to do something, you're going to do it with intention rather than halfassing it and just being like, \"Oh, at least showing up's half the job.\" like you need to declare how you want to show up into the world and then stick to those things and just start taking action. And the first bit of action sometimes is just removing the pleasures, starting to do some hardship. And that's also why I really love the gym because the gym requires discipline. Choosing what you put in your mouth versus what you don't put in your mouth requires discipline. Going to the gym when you're tired and working hard requires discipline. And when you show your mind what your body can do by doing hard things and the progress that comes from that, it gives you a bit of momentum where you can start to see and think about things more clearly and start applying that same discipline to other areas of your life. None of it might make sense in the beginning, but I truly believe if you're at least trying to define your values, if you get them wrong, they'll evolve. If you create a path for yourself and you go the wrong way, you will still learn and then you can create a new path from what you've learned there. But if you're just sitting down absorbing comfort constantly and not taking action, you're going to go absolutely nowhere. So realize that you already have faith in yourself. Take responsibility for your own life cuz no one's going to take it for you. Define who you want to become, the values that are going to get you there. And just start by doing something. That's all I got to say. And then the rest will come. I promise you, if you guys actually put the right effort into it and you're not spending your time absorbing [ __ ] the rest will come. With all that being said, my AC is starting to dial me in this car and I'm getting the [ __ ] hot as [ __ ] out and I'm sitting outside my gym ranting before going to workout. So, it's shoulders and arms. It's beautiful Saturday. I might have some French toast after this workout. So, if you bear with me through this rant, let's go out. All right, so I don't know how long I just ranted in the car. So, let me jump into this workout. I'm still doing really high volume giant sets. built a bunch of strengths doing a [ __ ] ton of volume. This is why programming is so important. I really think like the biggest cheat code of training is having proper periodization to not plateau where you can hit different stimuluses so that the body can the muscle can keep getting different stimuluses, continue to grow, not hit plateaus. I said I wasn't going to rant and here I go. So, shoulders and arms today. I got a giant set to start with a bunch of Oh, wow. This is going to be a lot. Damn. Shoulder giant set, tricep giant set, bicep giant set. Wish me luck. Come on. Come on. Come on. Yeah. Okay. All right. I have no idea if you can hear me because the fans are loud. I don't give a [ __ ] It's hot as hell. That was the first giant set for shoulders. All those exercises were back to back to back. No rest. Just as soon as you can get into it, you go. I took like a little bit of rest between the last two um prone lateral raises just because they were the same movement. I gave myself like 5 10 seconds and then blasted into it. Moving on to triceps now. This split currently I have a chest and tricep day, a back and bicep day, and a shoulders and arms day. So, I'm getting a good amount of volume in my arms. Trying to not have these skinny arms. I feel like genetically the first muscle I lose is my arms, which sucks being retired cuz like all you really need are calves and arms, but it is what it is. At least I have some calves sometimes. So, moving on to tricep. Same thing. Fore superset. Got my favorite tricep exercise in here. Well, close to the decline dumbbell skull crusher. The decline cable easy bar skull crusher. Mouthful. Probably one of my favorite tricep exercise of all time. Dumbbell is a close close call. Very similar movement. So, going to jump into this starting with the dip machine \nPage 4\nright behind me and I'll take you guys through it. Okay. Yeah. All [Music] right. So, wrapped up the tricep portion. Just by the way, I'm doing three rounds of all of these giant sets. So, 4 * 3 is 12 * 3 is 36. I'm not good at math, but 36 working sets in this workout. And obviously given that they're supersets, they're not at full intensity of which I were to take 60 to 90 seconds in between. So the capacity is less of course, but still it's a [ __ ] ton of volume into the arms right now. And this isn't something to do all the time. There's an intention that this is part of the program for like two weeks. This is blasting in high carbs in my diet the next couple weeks and then back to regular programming. So, with that being said, going to jump into biceps. I don't have a proper preacher curl flat bench, so I'm going to try and not hit my arms here. Lock it in and get the rest of my arms pumped. Oh yeah. [Music] Hey, Thank you. still a skinny [ __ ] but that's okay. Just wrapped up this quite high volume workout with a success. This was like a This is a pure Saturday workout. If you love volume, if you love lifting weights, and you want to get in 36 sets of arms, this is a beautiful way to do it on a Saturday, cuz there's no other time where you have enough time to do this kind of [ __ ] And if you're lucky enough that your gym is actually slow enough to do that many giant sets, then God bless. That's probably the biggest restraint when it comes to public gyms. But that's why when we were doing a lot of the programs in standard, we had to a few of the programs have some pretty extensive supersets in them, but we minimized them as much as possible, understanding that most people aren't in a rather empty gym. So, with all that being said, I've been here for way too long. Bradley's nap is about to wrap up and it's Saturday, so it's family time. So, going to head home, get some food in me, fuel up on carbs because I need those to shuttle into my biceps so I'm not a skinny [ __ ] anymore. That's it. What are you making, dude? Making you some sourdough French toast with turkey bacon. There you go, my love. Hit it. All right, so post-workout French toast. Courtney's famous French toast. We haven't started a tradition yet because Bradley's not old enough, but hopefully one day our kids are old enough where they can just eat whatever dad wants on a Sunday morning and this can be what we do. So, couple pieces of sourdough, French toast, cuz sourdough is a goat, turkey, bacon, and then whatever that stuff is, coconut whipped stuff. So, probably not a lot of protein in here, but it's all right cuz I had with a shake for breakfast, so we're balancing it out. And it tastes delicious. So, going straight to the arms today. Make that workout worth it. Damn. Byebye. \nPage 5"

she has to announce that all right so that's a wrap on today's workout moving to the open just kidding \na good workout grateful to be training out with some of the short Kings of the industry you didn't hear me yeah well I'm literally those that's less than dirt people you say so much \nmore people better watch it short Kings you want to \nlose a bunch of weight and come to Classic I don't think you're gonna ever make way like you said when we  retire we'll just \nswitch divisions but yeah so we're hungry because we've \nbeen standing for too long so we're gonna go search find some food we'll see you later [Music] \nthank you [Music] \nokay [Music] \nit's funny I don't get to introduce people that often that create the \nresponse that this guy creates when I walk back there wherever I see a long line I always say when you see a  long \nline well you know what that means you know it means that somebody in particular is at the head of IT these  days because it's turned out where he \nhas become such a great Ambassador for the sport for the industry and I know a \nlot of you guys are here to see him to meet him to get to take a photograph with him if you're so fortunate to  take \na selfie with him because that means if you post it on your social media you then will become a big deal so it is my great privilege to welcome the reigning champion of the classic \nphysique Olympia division one of the all-time greats one of the greatest to ever do it please welcome Stevo [Applause] \nall right what is up Pittsburgh you know what's funny if you guys know me I still \nget anxious to tell a public speaking talking in front of people but when Jim presented me with the  opportunity to either come up and talk in front of a \ncrowd or take my clothes off and pose with some students backstage right now well here I am I'm standing here  with \nthe mic so also it's pretty hilarious my mom called me and every time she got these shows if she sees these  guys she's \nlike Christopher are you gonna get big of these guys and I'm like Mom would you \nbut with that being said that's what you guys are unfortunate you guys are an absolute Retreat it's very rare  that you \nguys get on stage let alone together and they may not be in the best shape of their life but I can guarantee  you they're probably the biggest and then \nequally as expensive to see and something that's probably even more rare to see so if you guys are fans of  bodybuilding together for a helmetry if \nyou're watching the amateur show the pro show if you have aspirations to step on the stage one day this is the  show to be at right now this is full of just \nmotivation and inspiration so I hope you guys are all enjoying it enjoying the show I want to give a quick  thanks to the Manus minions for showing for \nputting on the show every year it's a beautiful show they give back to the city of Pittsburgh and they're  bringing up absolutely crazy Talent put on a show\nfor you guys so big can of Applause for the minions and beautiful show they put on \n[Music] foreign \nshow thank you [Applause] \nthank you we can't let them off the stage this easier man me and Dan came up with this business together with something called PBW which is probably doing weekly many many years ago so we cut our  team \ninterviewing guys just like you Chris and of course we can't let you out thank you to my friend got a few  choice \nquestions I know you said you're going for number five we had some good Builders along I give it a little bit  of a run but sebum's just been killing it \nman right I gotta asked the golden question Chris nobody ever asked Chris this question the classic physique division was put in not that long ago brand new what would you have done in your career or would you have had  a \ncareer if there was no classic physique division 2016 Metro is an open body builder in \nheavyweight and heavy weight not a super heavyweight at six foot one I'm probably one of the smallest guys on  stage I know \na lot of these judges where they judge me so thank you for that bro kind I appreciate it but I honestly was  ready \nto be done I did have a I didn't think I had a future an open minded living it wasn't something for me so it's  probably \nevery single year every day when I'm sitting on stage I'm so grateful for the classic media The Division I  think it's \nopened up such a bigger variety of scope of people to watch the sport and kind of \ncome into it it's a much more Modern Age thing and then we have all the divisions kind of checked out we got  the big Mass \nMonsters the shorter Math Monsters and the classic Adventures you've got everything something for everybody so  I'm very grateful that it's something \nfor me it's skyrocketed the joy and beauty of my life and everything I get to enjoy every day so [Music] the landscape would have been if this \ndivision doesn't exist t-bomb doesn't exist at least in the terms we know now he's amassed a huge follower you know it's fun watching the divisions uh come alive and when you think about it if there was no 212  divisions we \nmight not know the name Flex Lewis right if there was no classic physique division we might not know the name  Chris Homestead and you guys are in fact \na couple of the biggest stars in the world but the one question that I know you must get asked a lot is  talking \nabout whether or not you want to make the transition into the open Division I know that's something you have  to hear a \nlot so for the benefit of the thousands here and the millions watching around the world what are some of the  things \nthat go through your mind when that question is presented as you evaluate that possibility I don't know if  it's so \nmuch what goes through my mind but social school goes through my mind I see people like my brother and IEM I  see \npeople backstage looking at Walker big room and I'm like oh [ __ ] [Music] \nand honestly the first thing that pops in my head is I'm just so grateful to be where I'm at you know like I  said \nPlastics is he just giving me a beautiful life and so many moments that I will never forget every time I see these lights and do it reminds me to Olympia stage and I'm like it's given me so many moments and so many  experiences \nand brought so many people in my life that I can never think of living here right now so I'm just enjoying  where I'm at increasing enjoying the journey where \nI've had problems okay give it up [Applause] \nbefore I die that's not to say that people ask me all the time what is it about Chris mom said what's the fascination why are people so wrapped up in your life and your story and the way\npeople respond to you it's it's without a rival and I always say I sum it up in one simple word and this is  something \nthat if you're out there and you are aspiring Fitness celebrity or bodybuilder or somebody who is trying to connect with fans I will sum up Chris's Secret in one word and it is \nauthenticity there is perhaps no one who puts themselves out there exactly has as they are the way that you do Chris and for that we salute you and thank you \nAdvance on \nsolving no that didn't make sense \n[Music] \nit's dramatic intro \nall right so that's going to be wrapped on Pittsburgh got the train with Seth got the train with Derek it's a  good \nworkout got to meet a lot of people very grateful for it not grateful I had to go up on stage and talk I am  but I go up \nand down in my ability to speak last when I did Miami did a great job this time I trashed it the heart started  racing I got nervous I was like [ __ ] I \ndon't know what I'm saying and I just lost it but it is what it is you know maybe one day I'll be good at  public speaking but you think that the amount \nof time I've been on stage would get better but I'm nervous as hell every single time so it is what it is  welcome to the life of sebum I guess it'll never \nchange but I guess I just got to keep doing it until I get better because that's the only way to do it but  that \nbeing said I appreciate you guys watching back to Florida for a few days and then we're going off to Italy on  a nice little trip so hopefully me and \nCalvin can get like two videos or so this week so there's no gap of content like crazy when I'm traveling but  there \nprobably will be so forgive us for that thank you guys for watching appreciate you guys and I'll see you guys  next time"

    "text": "Chest Day with Blake ? Peak Week (Transcript) \nCaptured: 2025-11-05 ? Converted to PDF \nhad two burgers and fries and watched \nthe Alabama Georgia game which was a \ncrazy game like all the cor is All \nreleased was probably 10% better finals \nyeah that's the first time I've ever \nbeen better at finals there you go up \nwhat's up man how you feel good ready \nI'm alive I'm excited how are you me too \nyour show baby working on it oh yeah \nbomb show do you have like any food \nright now I'm honestly this is the most \nfood I've had at this point but my \nbody's using it so I still feel tired \nbut I'm at like 180 grams of carbs \nthat's not bad 150 to 180 depending on \nthe day at least it's not [ __ ] zero y \nI think the lowest I've ever been was 50 \nwow yeah one meal a day that's \nrough what is up YouTube back of the \nAthletic Club training some chess I got \nBlake with me today I stole some young \nblood our local classic physique recent \n[ __ ] here so he's got a lot more energy \nthan me he's a young blood classic guy \ncoming in so I'm trying to steal some of \nthe energy take it into me on this peak \nweek he doesn't need it right now he's \ngot lot lot of food in his system he's \nstarting his offseason I'm ending my \nprep so we're going to just he's going \nto help me push with this workout last \nchest day here in Florida hitting at the \nraw Athletic Club cuz we got some nice \nAC get to wear a hoodie and not drown in \nmy own sweat so yeah nothing \ncrazy for me at least still not trying \nto hurt myself that's it we train \nchest come \non \nyep yep Drive come \non squeeze your Ps \ncontrol that a little more from right \nhere fight it fight it fight it there \nyou \ngo another one come \non one more come on perfect for \nhim oh that's all \nyou oh \n[ __ ] there yeah that's a bodybuilder \ntrap it feels good but then your \nshoulders get Tighter and \nTighter I said I got to work on my \nshoulder \nMobility like there's anything that will\nreally help you at the beginning of this offseason is everything you do right now like those flies when you're doing the 140s or whatever you're pressing [ __ ] one second pause and then like all the way back try not to let your shoulders roll forward the whole time also want to just like do more stretching in general like I don't I don't do enough like actual like man if you do the proper range of motion you don't need to stretch it's actually crazy especially if you do it now yeah like last year with my side chest I would hit it and my arm was stuck out here and I couldn't turn and just this year from doing better range of motion I'm like back where I used to be \nyeah cuz we all know if you say you're going to stretch you're not going to stretch exactly how it goes every time so just do deeper Ranger motion yeah had a nice nap today for the first time in this prep pretty much Courtney was packing went to the spare bedroom was going to just listen to my audiobook and I just fell asleep and miss a full chapter for 30 minutes and couldn't believe it ien been that ball prep actually have some energy right now it's kind of \nnice I become an avid Napper when I start working out my energy picked up way more when I have more food than me for sure \nwhat weight do you normally work at on this huh what do you normally work at on this usually around four either three or four and then I'll go up to five for like a heavy top turn and then just back down one one one one all the way down to two are you going to go to Five this time maybe why you going five calling now right like I I got to feel it but if you are going to go to Five you just do like two reps two three reps two or three rep \n[Music] \nyes yeah I'll go to \nFive that felt good five five I can push on machines that's why we're here hey I'm just saying \nbro this will be let anything happen to you that wasn't heavy at all this can be your dumbbell de lo \nweek yeah I found I am it's different this time because we've been \ndoing much more of that stretch the Deep yeah it burns it quicker a lot quicker but like that's what I need to do I mean better for muscle growth and shoulder\nhealth and I'm also never one to like bro I could not give less of a damage about like what weight I'm pushing doesn't matter it's more so about just like if it's hard if it if it sucks and you can feel it like perfectly who cares what the number is if it's working it's [Music] \nworking Y come \non \ngood come \n[Music] \n[Music] \non good good control \nyep come on \ngood I'm not pushing nothing more than thato \num I do three plates and just bang it out get some blood Ming I'll go down to four probably four okay you want to do no that's \nfine the vibe \nwhat I think I took it a couple weeks ago \nI do mix that like impr prep you don't sweat like ever yeah it's the one thing I hate about I hate about an \noffseason it's nice when you truly enjoy the heat like you can go outside with 100 110 degrees in Florida yeah you're in prep and you like this is nice nice and \nwarm step outside and the peak off season you're like [ __ ] \nlet's go to work here come on \ny good squeeze in the top \nyep try and bring it a slight touch at the bottom every \nrep yeah I don't know if I can get down there do you go lighter no no it's not for your shoulders to feel it \n[Applause] \ncome on push \nthrough all the way through come on oh come on come \non I got I can't spot that [ __ ] yeah no I'm like no no I mean to \ntry they need like a pad or something stand around \nhere you [ __ ] to the warm-up reps bro you do a [ __ ] ton of warm-up reps oh I was just knock those in half yeah I didn't even I didn't even think it was warming up you were I'm already warm yeah but that was too late that was too late to work huh that's the point if you're already warm you feel that you're like all right just stop after two or three reps it's \ntrue especially in your offseason yeah it's\ntrue the two plays going to be heavy as [ __ ] \nprobably you mean for me or for you I don't know I think I think it's going to be pretty [ __ ] heavy \nbut you be the judge I've only done this once and I have no idea how much weight I did it's really \nnice yeah your range of motion is pretty nuts you're back here I I didn't used to be yeah it's honestly just this year I like spent the first 3 months literally just trying to get better range of motion yeah I mean I'm sure like there probably so many things that contributes to just in growth too I like break you're pretty much allowing for more development in every area I mean more range of motion is yeah it and like posing on St just going to be [ __ ] posing helps so much and just overtime injury prevention like I spent a couple years with a hurt shoulder doing nothing but pressing like this with shitty in motion my shoulders got worse and worse and worse spent 3 months opening up my Ranger motion and it's been way better beautiful okay \nthis is definitely a much Fuller pump than I usually get really yeah beautiful I just feel it more here cuz of the stretch yeah so much different it's [ __ ] helpful I'm telling you \nyep \ngood big come \non \ny I might strip a plate from this and try and really get more focus on that a plate in a 25 yeah cuz the two wasn't bad but I feel like it's just not doing myself any favors and not getting the full rep you \nknow I'm the guy you train with and go lighter than you normally do what's that I'm the guy you train with and go lighter than you normally do dude yeah like \n[ __ ] but I mean there's something to be said for you \nknow like I said earlier it's not the number you know yeah \ngive yourself a half second pause the stretch keep your arms bent a little more than that you need to Bent a little more so your elbows are going back instead of your forarm yeah like that go yeah I feel it \ncome \non come on squeeze it \nin another one come \non another one come on go\ngood last one one more right here one more come on come on squeeze squeeze squeeze squeeze squeeze and hold that right there let it just \nfall I've discovered that I mean I've known this but I just ReDiscover every year my weight drops I get [ __ ] so tired but then when I'm used to stabilizing at that weight I feel so much better like last week I dropped like 3 lb \ngot down to 245 and I was zombie mode like couldn't keep my eyes open dragging ass and I felt like that and I \nprogressively felt a little bit better cuz my weight's been stuck at 245 so it's like I'm just used to being at this point it's kind of nice honestly normally I feel worse at this point but I had my week of suffering at 3 weeks out two weeks out I feel okay one week out I die I said it's definitely a difference in like how because of the deep stretching it's like filling out the chest a lot more because like even when I like do something like that I can feel my chest pressing on my biceps more than usual it's like just little things I'm picking up on huh no no that's what we were saying it's like it's not about the number it's just about if you can get the right contraction off of whatever weight you're using and just making it suck as much as possible as much as you can and that's all really bodybuilding is at the end of the day that one over there is plate loaded so we can load that up with a lot of plates it's the exact same thing if you want to but we could also do like a um \none of the new tech presses or how much all I'm going to do little shoulders shoulders at the end I'm down you want to do that I actually always do shoulders with chest I know if you would or not I wanted you I probably might not do it but I wanted to make you do a specific dumbbell thing that'll help your shoulder and your decline Peck then that's exactly what I need but we can do that first cuz I need to do a flat okay and then I'll put you to do that you got more energy flat press first or do the shoulder thing first flat press first I officially wear Vans and birken stocks every day so if anyone's a size 13 I'll donate to you my \nJordan do a giveaway so let me \nknow okay on this one to do like a 3 second negative three two one one second pause oh one second then put three two\none one second pause \nSW 3 two \none little heavier there come \non keep that Tempo come on three two one one fight it come \non keep that pause at then come on you can still do it pause explode come on give me another full rep come on come \non slow down slow down oh [ __ ] that last one was like all you \noh yo I'm [ __ ] weak the hell is going on \nI hate that's what I do to people I show you how weak you really are no I appreciate it humbling \nexperience it's interesting cuz it's less of \na like I'll have that burn as I'm getting to the end of like where my capabilities of pushing it on my owners yeah and then it's like when we're getting those forc reps it's like I can feel just the end of the squeeze but I like can't feel it other than that you know what I mean it's like it's like my whole body's just like whoa it's something that you learning how \nto train with a spotter is like another skill to learn essentially know like you realize it's easier to train to just throw weight on and then fail at like six reps cuz you can't anymore or it's mentally like doing a negative that one second pause squeezing [ __ ] of it like prefer that yeah I'd prefer the \nnegatives and like making the lightest weight as hard as humanly possible cuz that's always when I feel is best but it's just like so interesting how sometimes you feel feel it so much and then it's just like can't feel it at all now and it's just like am I even pushing what's happening right \nnow come \non come \non \ngood let's go \ncome \non keep going come on controllers down yep go two more come \non squeeze your PE come on there you go come on just squeeze your PE the weight will move come \non \nokay yeah so it's so funny too in the off Seasons like you're like you have more energy but it's also like less you know you finish your set and you yeah and prep you're like your cardio is so much better your heart rate's like zero\noh yeah that's the nice I've been staying like really on top of my cardio and stuff like it's so weird too cuz you're in prep and you're like [ __ ] I do cardio and then you're in the off season you're like f cardio baby really I suck at Sticky up with my cardio dude I don't know why it's just been it's been really nice and the only thing too is like I'm a I'm type one diabetic so like it really helps with insulin sensitivity and stuff like that and I don't really have an issue with it or anything I did post show for a little bit um but uh but it helps keep it under ra perfect but yeah it helps so much and it's it's like a day-to-day noticeable difference like if I do fastic cardio one day blood sugars sit at like 80 the entire day if I don't do it they might bump up to like 110 120 and then they'll they'll sit around there and then come down a little bit and they'll like fluctuate a little bit it's so weird but like the stand effting 10-minute walks or whatever you know what that is yeah I've heard the name yeah he always he he was like every you eat something you go on a 10 20 minute walk right after for digestion and stuff I did that a lot in prep like every time I would eat it was like weird cuz my digestion was so like on point that I was like I don't want to go walk now but don't need to it \nhelps good yep come \non let's go good \ngood let work that's \nwork I got \nyou \nm you getting any pumps right now or no no not really the other day I had 500 gram of carbs and I still didn't even have a pump oh \nGod I always feel like it's the day after that's why I always got my I felt good the morning after like I felt full in my check-ins but I still didn't get that like feeling in the gym where you're like yeah oh \nyeah do you like any of these shoulder press pin loaded ones um I don't often use these I usually use this one plate loaded but have you ever used this \nthing that's the thing Brett's on right now lateral it's like one of my favorite I was going to do that at the end a slightly like Lean Forward L I was going to do that after but I want to super set of press \nwith this lateral this one's pretty nice yeah I haven't used this one\nbut it's a full stack \ntoo that's the thing about yeah that's the thing about these like this one that one I know I can full stack maybe that one it looks old it's got to be heavy what you good I don't know you tell me just let me know are any of these machines having \nI think that might be why I don't all right play loaded it \nis I'm going to go to two and a quarter have you ever gotten a uh Tension Headache \nbro I'm the king of [ __ ] tension headaches dude I have migraines twice a week where I'm like debilitated in a dark room crying I'm so glad somebody knows the pain the worst [ __ ] is awful [Applause] \ndude your arms are San WRA it's [ __ ] nuts right here I Haven want to tank top in a minute in this gym huh \nI haven't we a tank top in this gym cuz it's too cold yeah I bet it's nice for me right now yeah I'm fat and hungry you'd be [ __ ] in my gym \nyeah it's going to be a beautiful thing for your shoulder mobility in the offseason and your PEC Miner and a front Del take your word for \nit like instead of a normal neutral press where you're kind of like here you almost bring a little bit lower there okay just like stretch the [ __ ] out of it you know what I mean instead of there you it pulls you down your Peck a little bit more and you push like a decline okay yeah I get what you're saying don't even think about like going heavy and failure and dying literally just \nstretch feel it in the muscle and contract the muscle in that \nstretch like that no more neutral like tight tight tight tight all the way like oh like here like yeah as much as you can you might even need to go lighter to start yeah I mean it's not terribly heavy but it's just it's unbalancing well it's not it's not meant to be heavy at \nall feel like when you're here \nand see how you feel that stretch in your peck when it goes \nforward yeah I'm going to go down to like 50s and then see how that feels cuz I see exactly what you're saying I can feel that yeah but I want to get better contraction that's why I'm saying like it's not about this is muscle growth you practice your range of motion here and\nif you can get to the point where your body's used used to it enough where you can actually go heavy but now like I would do this at the end of all your chest days okay now work working set just like a strch like when you adjusted the dumbbell there at the end it like that pull oh [ __ ] um I'm going to grab 50s and try that come \non come on all \nin good good get \nanother what would you say has \ncontributed the most to your shoulder growth because you got some [ __ ] crazy shoulders I mean obviously genetics shoulders is the easiest thing for me to always grow but just just a implant shoulders are my thing that I've just been there yeah I always dumbbell press heavy as [ __ ] but they're just my genetic gift yeah shoulders on my like feel it's like right here you just got like some [ __ ] baseball in there or some [ __ ] cuz I used to be out to shoulder press more if not the same of what I could chest press damn yeah my shoulders just took over everything so they grew yeah like this year I haven't had a shoulder day in a year really I like this is I'll do should at the end of chest or something something but I haven't trained them all year \ndamn \n[ __ ] anything \nelse that's it for me do little ABS that's I'll do some ABS I never do so it's probably a good thing if I do I'm not doing anything crazy right now some leg raises cable \ncrunches I've never trained ABS in my off \nonce not proud to say \nit \nCRA don't put any of that [ __ ] about Derek \norotti CR

    "text": "Direction, Role Models, and a High?Volume Shoulders & Arms Day ? Transcript \nChris Bumstead (CBum) ? Cleaned transcript provided by user \nI got a DM the other day from this kid and he was asking me, not really asking me, but declaring that he felt lost. He had no direction in life. He's 20 years old. He sees me. I seem to have a clear path of where I'm headed and he doesn't know what to do. And it really got me thinking about a lot of things cuz let me be clear, when I was 20 years old, I had no idea what the ? I was doing either. But it really got me thinking about a lot of avenues of I've heard that a lot. You know, I've had a lot of conversations with people at events or DMs or whatever it may be of people saying things like this, and it's not a rare occurrence. And I feel like every generation has had their fair share of challenges. In the past, I feel like it was a little bit more physical obvious ones like war, poverty, disease, crazy ? which I know still exists in the dark world currently. But by and large, I feel like America as a whole on average, the younger generation, their problem isn't finding comfort in hard times, but in avoiding too much comfort and too much pleasure. And I feel like the odds are heavily stacked against the younger generation because I mean, first of all, there's billions and billions and billions of dollars of research going into how to make a phone, social media, anything highly, highly addictive. And we're given that giving kids those at like 8 years old. They have them in school, bring them around everywhere in their pocket. Social media is creating these like crazy role models of like do drugs, party, look cool, chase after girls, do all this ? And it's like absolutely absurd in my opinion. And I think the ability to abstain from doing the easy, pleasurable thing that's right in front of you and picture a life that you can dream of, asking yourself if a better version of yourself exists. what that version of yourself is. Picturing the plan to get there and actually starting and executing on that plan, I think is such a rare thing right now and so hard for people to stop and even think about given how much constant distraction there is in their life. And that's what made me want to ask this kid. I was like, do you believe a better version of yourself exists? And I'll get into that. But I really, this really got me thinking a lot about role models. Like the idea of a role model and thinking about how when I was young, I had everything so wrong. And I didn't really have a role model in my life helping me. Don't get me wrong, my dad was incredible, but he wasn't really like in my face on my case in my job knowing what I was doing. He was from a different generation. He wasn't close to my age or hadn't recently gone through anything I was going through. And I, full transparency, was just a dumb kid. I thought it was cool to party, to not try in school, to do drugs, to chase after girls, to do all these things. My friends literally thought it was cool to like, and it's funny cuz my brain is still kind of wired to be like, \"Yeah, it's fun.\" You know, of course it is. And people probably listen probably feel the same way, but to like think of going out and drinking and chasing after girls with no like connection or value for who the person is. To not value your education when you're sitting there doing it. To be wasting my time with an education of which I didn't even know where it was leading me cuz I didn't think about what I wanted my future to be. I was just following the path that was put in front of me. To have all these things in front of me that I didn't have someone looking at me and being like, \"Do you want to be like a better man? Do you want to be a man period?\" Because what I was doing was what boys do, you know, like playing video games and chasing after girls, thinking it's cool to do all these things rather than building meaningful relationships, working on my making myself a better, well-rounded, more educated man to be prepared for taking care of a family and being the man that a woman that I\nrespect would want to even be with. You know, I didn't have anyone kind of in my face being like, \"What the ? do you want to do with your life? Who do you want to be with your life?\" asking me if I wanted to be exceptional. You know, if you ask the average kid, do you want to be exceptional? Do you want to do something great with your life? The answer is usually yes. But their actions very rarely align with it. And I feel like I didn't have anyone. And you don't need someone. The responsibility lies within yourself ultimately always. But I do believe that like a role model could be a huge asset for pushing yourself to ask these hard questions and being like if you want to be exceptional, what you're doing right now is average or even below average. And if you want to continue to be average or below average your whole life, then continue doing this. But you need to make a serious change and start doing hard ? and letting go of the easy ? the comfortable, pleasurable ? Abstain from that to make a better version of yourself. I didn't have someone really asking me that. And it's kind of a it's kind of scary now that like social media because we don't have role models in a real life. So many people I believe and now social media is such a vast array of like who do we look up to? The one with the most followers. You're young. You get on social media. If at that time the realm you fall into it is people who are promoting gambling, sex, drugs. And I'm it sounds like trit to even say those words, but people are literally like smoking weed, promoting gambling and talking about how to get girls, how to sleep with girls casually on social media. And I really think as a whole, all those things hurt men more than they benefit them. It doesn't make you cool. It just kind of takes away from values, genuine real values in life. So essentially trying not to ramble too much. This kid asked me that question in the many times I've been asked. It really got me just thinking about wanting to share that when I was young I had no idea what the ? I was doing and I didn't have a role model and falling into the wrong role model can get yourself into a bad position. But someone being able to ask you what do you want with your life? Do you believe a better version of yourself exists? And take responsibility to take that in action. And the reason that question to ask yourself is do you believe a better version of yourself exists? Is because if you say yes, you are admitting that you have faith. You have faith that a better version of yourself exists. And the only way to move forward in life is by starting and just taking action. There's no book or 12step program or perfect way that it's going to organize things. And this sounds super trait to say. I know everyone knows that, but people still don't do it. Awareness doesn't mean anything. Action is all that matters. But what do you need for action? Sometimes people like, \"What do I need for action?\" Well, you need faith. And if you believe a better version of yourself exists, then you already have faith. So, as a young man, speaking to most young men, you need to have faith a better version of yourself exists. You need to take responsibility for your own life into your own hands. Most likely, you're not going to have a role model following you, telling you what to do, asking you these hard questions, and pushing in the right direction. You need to be the one to do that. So, where the ? do you start? easiest thing to do. Look in your life. See the things that are easy that everybody is doing. What's what in your life is like calls towards you that you can just feel as a vice when you're checking your phone all the time, playing video games, eating shitty food, doing all things. What calls to you that makes you want to do that everyone else is also called to and avoid those things. And just by avoiding those things, you are already going to be ahead of everyone else who's stuck into those things. And then being able to sit down and clearly define the values that are important to you. You can start with like an ideal person that you want to be defining those values. Actually think about that strictly. Like if you say you're going to do something, do it. Be a man of your word. You're not going to succumb to the easy pleasures. You're going to value delayed gratification over easy gratification. You're going to be respect every single person that you meet. You're not\ngoing to lie. You're not going to ? You're going to work hard. If you're going to do something, you're going to do it with intention rather than halfassing it and just being like, \"Oh, at least showing up's half the job.\" like you need to declare how you want to show up into the world and then stick to those things and just start taking action. And the first bit of action sometimes is just removing the pleasures, starting to do some hardship. And that's also why I really love the gym because the gym requires discipline. Choosing what you put in your mouth versus what you don't put in your mouth requires discipline. Going to the gym when you're tired and working hard requires discipline. And when you show your mind what your body can do by doing hard things and the progress that comes from that, it gives you a bit of momentum where you can start to see and think about things more clearly and start applying that same discipline to other areas of your life. None of it might make sense in the beginning, but I truly believe if you're at least trying to define your values, if you get them wrong, they'll evolve. If you create a path for yourself and you go the wrong way, you will still learn and then you can create a new path from what you've learned there. But if you're just sitting down absorbing comfort constantly and not taking action, you're going to go absolutely nowhere. So realize that you already have faith in yourself. Take responsibility for your own life cuz no one's going to take it for you. Define who you want to become, the values that are going to get you there. And just start by doing something. That's all I got to say. And then the rest will come. I promise you, if you guys actually put the right effort into it and you're not spending your time absorbing ? the rest will come. With all that being said, my AC is starting to dial me in this car and I'm getting the ? hot as ? out and I'm sitting outside my gym ranting before going to workout. So, it's shoulders and arms. It's beautiful Saturday. I might have some French toast after this workout. So, if you bear with me through this rant, let's go out. All right, so I don't know how long I just ranted in the car. So, let me jump into this workout. I'm still doing really high volume giant sets. built a bunch of strengths doing a ? ton of volume. This is why programming is so important. I really think like the biggest cheat code of training is having proper periodization to not plateau where you can hit different stimuluses so that the body can the muscle can keep getting different stimuluses, continue to grow, not hit plateaus. I said I wasn't going to rant and here I go. So, shoulders and arms today. I got a giant set to start with a bunch of Oh, wow. This is going to be a lot. Damn. Shoulder giant set, tricep giant set, bicep giant set. Wish me luck. Come on. Come on. Come on. Yeah. Okay. All right. I have no idea if you can hear me because the fans are loud. I don't give a ? It's hot as hell. That was the first giant set for shoulders. All those exercises were back to back to back. No rest. Just as soon as you can get into it, you go. I took like a little bit of rest between the last two um prone lateral raises just because they were the same movement. I gave myself like 5 10 seconds and then blasted into it. Moving on to triceps now. This split currently I have a chest and tricep day, a back and bicep day, and a shoulders and arms day. So, I'm getting a good amount of volume in my arms. Trying to not have these skinny arms. I feel like genetically the first muscle I lose is my arms, which sucks being retired cuz like all you really need are calves and arms, but it is what it is. At least I have some calves sometimes. So, moving on to tricep. Same thing. Fore superset. Got my favorite tricep exercise in here. Well, close to the decline dumbbell skull crusher. The decline cable easy bar skull crusher. Mouthful. Probably one of my favorite tricep exercise of all time. Dumbbell is a close close call. Very similar movement. So, going to jump into this starting with the dip machine right behind me and I'll take you guys through it. Okay. Yeah. All [Music] right. So, wrapped up the tricep portion. Just by the way, I'm doing three rounds of all of these giant sets. So, 4 * 3 is 12 * 3 is 36. I'm not good at math, but 36 working sets in this workout. And obviously given that they're supersets, they're not at full intensity of which I were to take 60 to 90 seconds in between. So the\ncapacity is less of course, but still it's a ? ton of volume into the arms right now. And this isn't something to do all the time. There's an intention that this is part of the program for like two weeks. This is blasting in high carbs in my diet the next couple weeks and then back to regular programming. So, with that being said, going to jump into biceps. I don't have a proper preacher curl flat bench, so I'm going to try and not hit my arms here. Lock it in and get the rest of my arms pumped. Oh yeah. [Music] Hey, Thank you. still a skinny ? but that's okay. Just wrapped up this quite high volume workout with a success. This was like a This is a pure Saturday workout. If you love volume, if you love lifting weights, and you want to get in 36 sets of arms, this is a beautiful way to do it on a Saturday, cuz there's no other time where you have enough time to do this kind of ? And if you're lucky enough that your gym is actually slow enough to do that many giant sets, then God bless. That's probably the biggest restraint when it comes to public gyms. But that's why when we were doing a lot of the programs in standard, we had to a few of the programs have some pretty extensive supersets in them, but we minimized them as much as possible, understanding that most people aren't in a rather empty gym. So, with all that being said, I've been here for way too long. Bradley's nap is about to wrap up and it's Saturday, so it's family time. So, going to head home, get some food in me, fuel up on carbs because I need those to shuttle into my biceps so I'm not a skinny ? anymore. That's it. What are you making, dude? Making you some sourdough French toast with turkey bacon. There you go, my love. Hit it. All right, so post-workout French toast. Courtney's famous French toast. We haven't started a tradition yet because Bradley's not old enough, but hopefully one day our kids are old enough where they can just eat whatever dad wants on a Sunday morning and this can be what we do. So, couple pieces of sourdough, French toast, cuz sourdough is a goat, turkey, bacon, and then whatever that stuff is, coconut whipped stuff. So, probably not a lot of protein in here, but it's all right cuz I had with a shake for breakfast, so we're balancing it out. And it tastes delicious. So, going straight to the arms today. Make that workout worth it. Damn. Byebye."

Chest Workout & Coaching Announcement (Transcript) Compiled: 2025-11-01 08:07:32 \nwhat is up YouTube \n[Music] \n[Music] \nforeign \n[Music] \n[Music] \npeople forget like you make decisions and you just like feel it out you live \nyour life and then the world's talking \nabout it like why are you hiding this and it's just like I've just lived in my \nlife you know but yeah so as you guys know video before this I guess will be sadly meaning they're no longer working together but the exciting news is me and honey are working together now the \nprocreator the 20 times the Olympia Champion coach 20 20. \nsoon to be a few more hopefully more yeah oh yeah we've been working together for a few weeks we I mean we \nstarted talking in August officially and I kind of shocked him a little bit he \ndidn't know I would want I \nwas like talking briefly like maybe we could like help me a little bit like this \nand that and then I called him I was like so how do you feel about \ncoaching me he's like a [ __ ] coach coach like everything I'm like yeah he's like [ __ ] man at the last minute it was \ndefinitely from Left Field a lot of people think this thing's been going on for a long time it actually hasn't a lot \nof it had to do with the fact that when we started talking originally I think it \nwas the Arnold we were just the first \ntime we were just you know conversing but later on it was more about just hey what are your different techniques regarding you know mental mindset and some of those other things and \neventually there were some videos that were made regarding us working together when we weren't working together and the \nonly thing that came about that was the conversation of eventually men working together it actually started the \nconversation it wasn't what was actually happening which is really funny I have the text of her it's my text message hey \nTony hey it's Chris it's my number the next one what the [ __ ] is this video man you text me the question mark question \nmark what's this video like people saying we're coaching and I'm like [ __ ] like let me call you in a second and I called them and I was like well like you know I've been like we've talked about you helping me with my [ __ ] and you know somehow we got out there whatever and then it would blew up and I was like so \nwhat do you think I was like oh you're serious \nbe pretty cool and he said no no no let's think about doing the whole prep and then obviously it was a very big \ndecision because it was came from Left Field because I I've never somebody who's\nan actual somebody who's actually \nbeen winning the Olympia in the past when I worked with other athletes it was somebody that had started with me or had \nended up winning the Olympia with me or had come back after losing the Olympia uh 2009 Jay Cutler \num but it wasn't obviously it's a lot of pressure but it was also from left field so there was a lot of conversations back \nand forth on how that would work but uh obviously as I got to know Chris and be able to talk to him many many hours on \nthe phone FaceTime all those things being able to understand kind of what the process is what his process is I \nfelt like it was a it was going to be something or I could definitely help sure yeah I mean I don't think you were \ntoo fond that it was 16 weeks out or what whatever it was yeah because he says like I only work \nwith people and have a full year of off-season learning your body getting where I want and then we start prep and I'm just starting prep like this so but we're gonna make it work you know yeah I thought my first rodeo it's not your first rodeo so a little challenge too \nbut we'll make it work yes I'm excited you know like you guys know me I'm very laid back I'm pretty like loose like just try and chill take what I can Honey's very like everything's got to be perfect like what's this going on what's this what's this what's this very like \nmeticulous and I think the combination of those two things of him like filling the gaps where I might like Overlook because I'm just like do my [ __ ] and he's like on it for me I think that's gonna flow together really well you know what I'm told to do I do is 100 and he's \ngonna tell me what to do and then we're gonna [ __ ] do it so excited yeah and you're not used to being told what to do \na little bit but not fully new everybody laughs at that our house Courtney Calvin are like oh my God someone telling what \nto do I'm like is that that rare for me but I guess so so I know I can hear it though and it'll be exciting to try \nsomething you knew you know obviously we've spoken we're not changing the wheel no you know I mean obviously he's \none it's the thing but there's a lot of Young and Hungry guys coming after you want to really try to make some improvements and like you said ideally I'd like to live to start working together in January or February but um it just it stars aligned right now and \nthis is what we want to do because we want to be able to try to bring in the best version of Chris possible and just \nget in there and try to combine the formulas and be able to take it to the next level forever Improvement yeah yeah \nyeah I mean it's been good so far you know not a huge change of stuff you got some fst7 sets we add in little things \nbut overall training is similar it's intense keep your strengths at the beginning of prep like I always do I \nstill get to do my heavy squats my heavy presses all that [ __ ] with the little\ntweaks on the end so yeah it's been good so far and I know we'll be going forward \nso yeah yeah I'm gonna [ __ ] [ __ ] up four-time Olympia coming up soon that's it brother all right now it's chest day \nso we got to get to work we'll show you how we work right now so stay tuned so let's start start with the incline let's \nget you warmed up there see how you feel and then if everything feels really good we'll start moving \nstuff done early and then we can use some fs7 stuff again but let's just really make sure that you have the \nability to be able to do that everything so we can build that base to keep it stronger yeah \nso did you start a heavy dumbbells start there and there after you're warmed up and we do a good working set two working \nsets there then we're going up here all right [Music] \nhave you used this machine before no okay you just got it like I was looking for one myself \nthe actual start oh maybe a little bit yeah \n[Music] \nhalf inch one's actually okay \njust go a little lighter you're still kind of a little narrow yeah it's good for warm-up but as we get into heavier \nsets it should go a little wider and you know you have to wait it seems like you would \nbe amazing but you want my elbows play up here or more like lower not out just right there right here \n[Music] \nyou'll have a little \nright come on Chris got it good \ndon't go again all the way up push push press push fire \nhigher higher oh good slow good job [Music] \nthe heavy machine it's a good movement though yeah as \nyou're arching and you're driving it's perfect just make sure you keep your chin up so you can just make sure you get a little extra on the very end because sometimes you're gonna have to catch yourself not being able to extend all the way chin down because you feel \nlike your chest is flexed all the way it really is it yeah a little further up I feel like I'm flexing harder when I do this you know because I'm like pushing it all the subconscious then I'll just \ngo here right now a little bit \nslowly number three two one \nthere you go come on \ncome on \ngood partial three three one two one \nmore \nheavy it is heavy yeah ain't no Hammer strikes \nyep it's all Flex machine is very heavy so if you never use a support it definitely it literally feels like three plates if not more in a way so I feel\nlike it's almost three place when you're using it or do you feel like like you're mentioned three please yeah yeah a lot \n140s one I think 140 would be good because you just did six and it felt okay but you're a little tired from last \nnight's right now yeah so I think like if we're going to be pushing into that set range about eight to ten I don't think you're going to be able to if you feel 150 is solid or if you feel like \nwhen I first exercised on a good day start with 150 I get 10. okay so after that you just went over that first exercise too \nright \nfor the light [Music] \nseconds go go go \none more \nperfect symmetry yesterday we do rows 140s press 140s balances here you probably don't have a weak back it's all about the balance yeah same way let's go \nwhat on the way let's go \nwith me \n[Music] I feel so good controlled but hard \nbefore that so let's move into a power press while \nwe're still on the incline mom's new show do you want to go with that wedding kind uh \nno I want to keep it gear I want to work on that upper see how that goes I've been doing this every chest and they \nfeel good but it's just different for me the way I have the long arms it's hard for me to tuck like when I'm pressing \npeople out with a girl but it's so flared but like my arms are just so long so when I do this actually you need to stay gloves it's a good mix I guess yeah if you get some good flexion yeah you're keeping your shoulders and back and your chest out it's just arch your back and \nthen just drive this prep yeah because I think that other spot is just gonna be good good chin up okay they're good there you go come on \nChris \n[Music] good looking out go \npush push it together together good job good \nnot bad don't feel better a little more speed though yeah \nsolid definitely got a good range of motion on it too fast \nthis is all about like a foundation set that you're going to be able to use as much weight as possible within reason \nwithout getting hurt but keeping it in that eight to ten range but work your way up to it but this is going to be one \nof those things where we're not going to be doing like I don't want to do any just really get up to that point where \nyou hit that 8-10 then you feel like it's too late so \nwe're here \nwithout six and see if that's still warming up \ngoing out the working set and making sure \n[Music]\n[Music] \ngo go come on \nslow slow slow [Music] \nwe're doing the tricks there one more one more one more I still know how to count \npays off [ __ ] they're counting over and I don't understand one thing I was excited about when we \nstarted working together I think a lot of people misconstrue what fsd7 is and they just think you're a huge volume guy and people like Chris you don't train like that at all blah blah I was like it's not how he trains not everything is seven sets of 20 and like killing it's like still the foundation same as always muscle requires strength to hold on to \nwhen you're prepping you're eating less you need to be strong to hold on to that muscle so like it's still listening \nheavy if not heavier than I've always trained at this point in prep and then you throw in some volume at the end or \nthe beginning if you need it right and as you do at the end but it's still getting strong and with some heavy weight same [ __ ] it's a little harder at the end yep just making sure you manipulate both \ntypes of fibers because you need to be able to be stronger so you can handle heavier weights so that even when you're \ndoing high volume you use heavier weight on high volume a lot of people think that it's just seven sets for two or \nthree exercises and that's it and you go lighter it's not how it works if they wish it'd be nice if you get used that \nwouldn't even be fun actually no one wants that gotta earn it \nthe picture good \ncome on slow I need slower negative I need so \nI'm going to help with the positive that's why it looks so easy come on together now slow hold it hold it there hold it hold it come on Chris work on the East Center come on slow slow one more one more come on let's go finish strong slow \ngood and release good job \nit's beautiful I love it there you go \nI feel ashamed Connie told me I had to shave my legs because my legs are so [ __ ] hair you can't tell how lean \nthey are I never shave my legs until like four weeks out last minute unless you're leaving to shave my calves so I'm \nlike a Hobb it up to my knee it might be a new look see if I can get this trending I guarantee you you can't \nI hope not \ngood \none more good warm-up sets are open \nthis is the goat test machine do you have it find it take all the stress out of bicep forearms everything it just \nsqueezes from the elbow which feels great hard to find though yeah very hard to find one of my favorite machines I \nused to use this back when I was competing really helps with getting that really\ngreat contraction without having \nyour arms kick in like Chris said and what you want to do is you want to make sure that I like to go in over and under \njust so that you don't end up just using one side as a dominant side so every rep switch \n[Applause] nice come on \nkeep going keep going go go [Music] \ngood go go come on Chris come on you got this \nyou got this three-part let's go one one two two \nthat's it \nwe have worked long the long work the other long enough for me to know what he looks

in the Carbone area yeah right through there that made some improvements the \nlast couple weeks and um trying to jam in as much as you can in terms of these types of different \nvariations and these exercises to get those muscles to grow those muscular just I just want to see \nwhat that looks like on you chest up yeah there you go \n10 weeks out today so it's out today \nthank you \nthere you go

\nforeign \nforeign \nfor a few days trying to get shredded trying to get huge fine-tuning everything make sure everything's right \non point where we want it to be for the rest of the prep 10 weeks out today so getting close but yeah I mean new coach \nthis year not a whole lot of variables crazy things are going to change I think he's pretty basic and he pretty like \njust persistent on Little Things fine-tuning them everything you need to do is level yourself up getting better \nhe always says one percent one percent one percent one percent adds up slowly and gets you to be 10 20 better which \nadds up slowly even a few percentage at my level is a big change so it's exactly what I'm trying to do right now just \nfine tune all the little things for those of you who don't know honey maybe\nsomething because they're young or not in the bodybuilding World he's coached some absolutely amazing people and does some creative things with them from Phil Heath Jay Cutler Seth roasty coaching \nDerek Lunsford right now hottie children a whole bunch of people very successful and honestly I never thought that I \nwould ever want him to coach me I never was like he's good good he's had success he's worked with other people who are good who you know I never were like oh he's who I want I always respected what he had done obviously because he'd been very good but I never wanted anyone other than e and The Coachman I never even thought outside of that because it's just we were with an Olympians why would I change you know but circumstances presented itself or we needed to change and I met Hani and she kind of like lined up perfectly right when I was thinking we coached me I met \nhim and I spoke with him and I was like [ __ ] I just like connected with what he was saying I saw how passionate he was and how intense he was about winning and \nobsessed he wasn't winning and like being the best version that you can be for yourself beating yourself the year \nbefore all the way we spoke and communicate about his mindset and the way he handles stress and kind of has worked with competitors at a high level winning multiple championships which people don't understand the level of like mentality that comes into like \nwinning again and again and again and keeping not getting comfortable not letting your foot off the gas and kind \nof keep pushing harder because people are getting better and better especially when you set up new standard they're reaching that new standard getting better so you keep setting a new standard every year and he knows how to do that so you know when we spoke and I \nkind of connected with someone like [ __ ] this just felt right the timing was perfect and I kind of kept it inside me for like six months since we're back at the Arnold I think when we first spoke and I didn't speak to him didn't say anything I was just like that could be interesting you know maybe and here we are so I'm excited it's been great so far I feel like I'm in a very good spot at this point and I'm fired up I'm \nmotivated I just feel excited for this Olympia prep right now I'm feeling good so shit's gonna be good very good very \nexciting

YouTube Transcript Date: 2025-11-03 (Asia/Seoul) \nis that what your poo looks like after \nfiber \nno your poo looks good after fiber \nthat's what your poo looks like before \nfiber \n[Music] \n[Music] \n[Music] \ngreetings \nwhat is up youtube welcome to another \nfull day meeting everyone's favorite \nvideo for reasons we will never know but \nas i've been telling you guys it's time \nto stop being a skinny [ __ ] it's time \nto get huge look season has officially \nbegun so i'm going to be bringing you \nguys what i literally said that last \ntime \nthe season we're in it's the series the \nbulking series i'm gonna say the intro \nevery single video anyways i'm gonna be \nshowing you guys what i'm eating in an \nattempt to get bigger so it's not crazy \nright now because i wasn't eating a lot \nbefore but i'm slowly increasing my \ncalories 500 or so at a time and yeah \nwe're gonna be going over that today so \nbreakfast basic [ __ ] breakfast i've \nbeen hating eggs lately i haven't even \nreally been liking pancakes i was eating \nchicken and rice bison and rice for a \nwhile in the morning but we switched \nthings up to a smoothie lately so i'll \nshow you guys how i make this\nyou are something else \nwatson \ncome \n[Music] \noh \nall right so this is one of the tricks if i remember to apply i do but you put your oats in so by the way i'm letting go smoothie obviously but if you put your oats dry into a cup and blend them before putting them into the smoothie it becomes like flour and then it absorbs a lot better and it's less like granular when you drink it so this is 120 grams of oats \ni wonder if you should flour then there oh flower yeah really i guess i could buy that \nthe real men do it \nstep one \nthis is what happens when you leave your freezer door open too \npolar express \nraspberries \nand \nblues \n[Applause] \nthere's no \nspecific amount of fruit that goes in here just whatever \nfalls in the \ncup \non that day \nbut blueberries have them right now a little extra \nfor whatever reason i put in two ice cubes for a good luck\nwater \ni also like to water it down a little \nbit so it's easier to drink \nas opposed to being thick where you need like a straw i just want it to like be a much thinner consistency \nyou should just drink it like that \ni think you could drink food \nstep three \nfiber \nso i pooped myself properly instead of pooping myself improperly because no one wants that use code sebum this is actually a super underrated supplement i don't think a lot of people get enough fiber so i like to blast myself a little fiber in the morning hopefully you go to the bathroom after which i always do consistently and then you have a great day \nall right so then two scoops of vanilla protein vanilla \nis the absolute goat in \nprotein chicken i mean smoothies because it just tastes good this one \nspecifically i don't know what it is but that little oatmeal kick in it makes smoothies taste so much better and then i add my \nflour in here and then it looks like an aggressive amount of powder just hang it in there but actually blends \nsurprisingly well believe it or not \nfinally \nthe last step \nsome organic creamy \nalmond butter for some fats\nthat what your poo looks like after fiber \nno your poo looks good after fiber that's what your poo looks like before fiber you're welcome so yeah 31 grams of that normally 30 but it's close enough put a little more water on top so it blends \nefficiently \ni'm gonna overflow it's not gonna [ __ ] blend oh \nwatch me \nthis one \nthis is the max fill line \nof little faith that's [ __ ] no one \nactually follows that [ __ ] that's like seeing the speed limit how fast we're supposed to drive on the road \n[Music] \nlook at that \nnow without the fill line see \nthe powder settles you didn't you didn't open it right did it open right \nthen you're supposed to take the bottle and then \nlike \nwhip it \nso that all the fluid goes to the bottom there's nothing on the blade and you didn't use one of that centrifugal force no i don't know what's called gravity yes \nnormally don't get [ __ ] stuck on the sides so so \nwhen i put it back on it doesn't leak you mean \nwell you already already [ __ ] it up\nyep \nwhat am i supposed to do this yeah no you're supposed to like \nso like \nthis is here and then if you want all on the bottom you like flip it down \nyeah there you go \n[Laughter] \nsmash it on the ground \nit's still covering the [ __ ] well \nbecause your shit's so thick \ndelicious i have no money no many i have no idea how many calories are in this so i'm gonna calculate that \nthrow up and then be right back so uh i did some the sourcing \nand what you said the wrist does not outweigh the reward is actually wrong i know it was wrong we thought about it last night it took us 20 minutes what did i say the risk does not outweigh the reward yeah it doesn't sound better to say that and the risk outweighs the reward \ni feel comfortable when you say the wrist does not outweigh the reward sounds better the other way is just i \nthink it's because when you add do not does not it like [ __ ] everything up so it doesn't sound as good it's not not it weighs over yeah there you go \ni wonder if this is a thousand calories you think so no not unless you put a lot of peanut butter or almond butter all right so total calories are 931. 72 grams of protein 23 grams of fat and 114 grams of carbs so all that fit in to\nthis little ball of purple \ngoodness and it tastes good and easy [ __ ] to get down so \nthat's breakfast eat these 900 calories of the day \nthen i'm gonna get two meals together bring in the office me and calvin gotta head over so i'll see you guys for meal number two \nhe's soft what you're a softie \nno you talk to her in a baby voice when i'm not around \nhe does did she tell you that he's laughing did she tell you that she told me and i hear it i'll catch you in 4k doing it 4k \n8k \nyou should do that i'll do this and then i'll do this and it's like i'm opening the next \nno what would you do if i wrote on that well this is your lens actually \nno let me write a smiley face i already cleaned this when i got it \ni almost dropped that i would have cried chicken smells like poo does it you boil your chicken you don't no \nall right meal number \ntwo \nis 180 grams of chicken breast 250 grams of white jasmine rice and 20 grams of macadamia oil of the oil mass office but this is \nbasically the best family with you i was eating vegetables for a while now i was lazy and i just put them in this meal today but not very much to say about\nthis the key to success bodybuilding getting big is preparation so if you go to work bring meal prep normally i have megafit to be honest and they started making a literal like bumble it was turkey ground turkey rice and olive oil that was it it was delicious but i forgot to order it last week because we were traveling so i actually had to cook two meals for work today but i was prepared to go this is meal number two i [ __ ] up my diet already yeah i was trying to i have a bison meal and a chicken meal and personally i tried to have the bison meal earlier because a little bit slower to digest than chicken and i use so i like to have chicken before the gym but i'll be fine i'll eat an hour and a half before the gym i don't even know what i'm supposed to talk about in this video when you eat what do i eat \ni will say this i don't think there's an optimal amount of food over one meal that you should eat before working out if you bother that when should i work out how many meals should i eat i think it just matters on what your goals are if you're bulking how is it easiest to eat a lot of food personally if i only eat two meals and i work out for like two hours and i come home a little tired lazy me eating three meals and a shake so after working out is really hard but two meals super easy so i know with that knowledge i need to have three meals before working out or i'm gonna miss a\nmeal or be hard to eat a meal whereas when i'm dieting i'm always hungry at night so i try and only eat two meals really spread out in the morning train and then i get to jam my last three or four meals closer together at the end of the day my cravings hit me at night my hunger hits me at night i'm sitting around doing nothing at night so i know i have those meals so \nthere's no like proper way to do it i personally think \nas a bodybuilder trying to put a muscle you should at least eat one meal before training have some food in you for fuel but i don't think there's an optimal number other than that so just \norganize your day in terms of what is going to be easiest to adhere to your plan \nbut yeah so i'm going to eat this um \nmove on with my day \nsmallest smells good okay \nwas it smaller blue raspberry smells like blue red looks like a little \ncrystal light there you go \nactually pretty good probably not good to mix chicken and rice that's right this is the perfect time to drink it i like it \nthere you go maddie j \npeople like it probably not chris but other people do \nthat's good \ni thought there's like a film of texture here you feel that it's thick then\nyou're looking at it \nyeah but look at the inside of it too but let's see the cloudiness the last one we drank it felt like just water with flavor all right that feels like there's like a little plemis phlegm yeah so we don't like it well they like hot and trying to hydrate you want really put their correct amount of water i put 16 ounces in five grams probably not that's why i have so much left over look i think diluted \nyeah 16 ounces \ndoubling hydrate powder and chicken at the same time \ndon't take my judgments today do you think someone would notice if i stole that \nnope \nyeah \npoppy's not eating today \nshe's sacrificing for her father \ni gotta get big \nshe did she's already jumped in would you rather have to eat one of courtney's hands or hudson courtney's hand i'm not eating the woodson she already doesn't have enough time on this earth microwaves \neverybody said brain waves \ninstead of whatever else can we how much water do you consume a day that's a good question i probably have six of these two when i work out and then two more after that's like nine of these maybe so that is \n20 ounces\ntimes nine it's 20 ounces \nthis could be completely wrong \n20 ounces times nine it's 180 ounces how many milliliters is that 500 5 \n323 \ni don't know why i put in the milk 5.3 liters 5.3 liters \nso let's just how many gallons \njesus christ 1.4 liquid gallons so you drink approximately 1.4 gallons that's probably accurate because one day i did actually have a gallon to see if i was going to drink it and i drank it like halfway through the day so yeah but the truth is if you walk around with a gallon or a big thing of water and you always have it you're going to drink more water okay subconsciously i just kept looking at it and i was like \ni gotta finish the gallon so i just kept drinking it more often and i feel like i drink more that day so i don't know if \nyou're somebody who doesn't get water and just walk around with water all the time but always hold on wouldn't it be easier walking around with that would it be easier yeah to find easier \nis it easier to have something small and carry with you all the time or that you have something big that you never have to refill \ndepends on your personal life \nlittle bit of circumstances \nis it easier to eat a cake in one \nsitting or throughout the day \nthroughout the day \nexactly\nso let's see anything with this \nyeah but you're not drinking in one sitting or walking around with it all the time so you never have to refill it so you're still drinking it all day but what if you have to look at the cake all day you start to hate it \nnow you're just getting personal who hates water though \neveryone water is life literally \n[Applause] \n[Music] \nthat was 15 grams right that was like 45. i was like 15. \nwasn't this bottle full when you got it when i bought it yes usually you buy stuff no no like when you had it this \nmorning no of course not i didn't bring a new bottle you used \nyou used 120 grams today 120 grams of bacon tablespoon oil he's lying that's dramatic that was like 15 grams but meal number three is \n180 grams of bison 270 grams of white rice 15 grams of macadamia nut oil it's about 750 calories for this meal very delicious training in like an hour and a half \nish so should be able to digest the fats by them it's only four \nwe'll be good to go \nbut yeah so i \nlike i did that food allergy test and i'm not supposed to be eating \nbeef right now so i switched it with bison whatever no big difference license honestly tastes a little better\nso this is going down \nreason i switched to magnet oil \nmore monounsaturated fats it has less omega-6 in it which can be inflammatory when you have a lot of them so you want to be conscious of your ratio omega threes to sixes with a higher omega-3 higher omega-3 content hence magnesium mineral hence why i also take a lot of fish oils like 20 pills a day of fish \noil just to help with inflammation \nbecause anti-inflammatory diet is life oh yeah does that mean you leak i mean i smell bad no you leak oil maybe that's why i do smell bad you think no maybe if you have too much fish oil sometimes you leak \nleak yeah does that mean like if we cutter your butthole oh your butt \nwas burnt out i think that means you need ox pile i don't know what that is if ever you're having trouble digesting fat ox bile helps a lot with that \ngive it a shot but yeah so this is \npre-workout meal fueling up for a big old arm day again should be having veggies i'll have them all later tonight but if you're not sebum and you want to get a sick pump for the gym without the [ __ ] of that meal before the gym drink a lot of water leading up to your workout salt the [ __ ] out of your pre-workout meal help you buy hydrated \nget lots of water hydrate the muscles get a little more energy in there and you'll get a better pump as well so salt is life unless your sibo\nwhat are those \nsome you easy slides i gotta give a shout out to my boy because i was at the gym \nand someone was like oh i saw your sneaker collection online and he owns a resale kind of business so he gave me a pair of easy slides because i didn't have any and i always wear flip-flops but it is called saving souls for him at saving souls for him so if you need some sneakers check him out got me some easy slides so big thanks that was really nice that was real loud a little aggressive what's that \ni haven't decided what i'm eating yet so i'm just sipping on a \ngallon of orange juice i wish at the moment i wish orange juice was macro friendly \nbecause i drink it every day i wish it had protein and better carbs in it that wasn't fructose it's only one ingredient oranges \ni know but if i could literally live off this if it was like the macros i could drink this all day every day \nway too tart \nhave you never had orange juice with like a nice like pancake and like oh for sure breakfast yeah orange juice is amazing but like a few like a glass this big not like chugging i literally i'll \nshow the leader \nthis is our rice cooker shout out to david laid for showing us this chris for this i discussed this race cooker by\nyoutube yet thank you so much do i have already but you just didn't show it oh well this is this is this this all right this is this zoji \nit's on amazon it's like 180 bucks but it holds 10 cups dry rice and cook in there and then you cook it in about an hour and then it stays warm for up to infinite hours but i tried to leave it that long so i'll leave it in here for like what do i go up to like 72 hours something \nsits in there for three days hot stays good it's hot \nand whenever you want just scoop it out ready to eat warm and ready to go so hello \nscale of one to ten port yeah how much do you enjoy cooking for chris \nit's my full-time passion on scale one to ten how much are you actually just a i'm a slave \ni actually enjoy it \n[Music] \nwhat like we do a lot of bulk cooking but it's not like they're big meals like this \nit's not what \nprep meals now that i'm gonna \n[Music] \nwell because he's not here during the day so i don't have to do so i don't really do this \nbut when he is here \ni do \ni do \nwould you say that over the years you\nhave converted him to keep eating completely organic \ni don't know what would you say babe not [Music] \ndon't completely \nmy food influence has influenced him yes or no \nhe just doesn't want to give anyone credit besides himself so \ni'm pretty sure \ni \nyeah but our dog will bark \ni'm so sorry she still got a mess so sorry i didn't mean to hit your daddy yes i did but it's \nno she was scared she got sad \nno no no i don't like beer it protects me yeah she protected me that's proof that i get abused at home oh my god i get beat at night \nthat's what she get physically abused and then she makes me food and i'm like you can't complain now \namber heard \nall right post-workout meal consists of 180 grams of chicken breast 20 grams of olive oil i think i don't know again she's poured it on the pan you're always unsure of the amount of olive oil can you try and say olive oil okay \noil olive olive olive oil 280 grams of rice and half an avocado \nand some serrano condiment yellow bird sauce \nand zucchini \nstick to zucchini okay do you follow carnivore md\ni do \ndid you know that seeds and plants have defense chemicals for humans so we can't digest i've heard \ni've heard yes \ni think you just gotta listen to your body what feels good \ncan you digest this \nzucchini feels good in my body good that's good zucchini is very good and prep very low calorie easy to digest you know \noh \nyeah behind the kids there's a lot going on right now \nall right so yeah post-workout meal 850 calories \nsee you in the next one \nthis is chris thinking i don't cook for him \nwhat is this platter this is just some roasted organic potatoes a little olive oil salt some seasoning and i'm trying to crisp them up right \nyes \nbut when's your cookbook coming out i'm working on it \noh he can pick it up too well he's like uh \nlike a \nsuper strong character \nshould be that big sharp eh \nare you carnivore md yeah i'm full carnivore \nthese are actually fake potatoes they're sliced up quail limitation potatoes potatoes\nthose must be very comfy because you've been wearing them ever since you go home actually everybody come in like a lie i never wanted to get because they looked a little goofy but \nsorry my life right \nwith my big ass you look silly \nyes reportedly found this bread it's a rustic potato sourdough three main ingredients flour water salt and it has zero grams of sugar in it and it's soft it's delicious it's white \nbut sourdough there's sea salt in it as well \nenzymes whatever enzymes are but sourdough one of the best breads you can eat \nso \ni like to eat healthy but sometimes i branch out a little bit from sourdough bread \na little sneak peek right here i wanted to mention these because we just got them in finally we're doing an event i haven't even announced this we kept it pretty low key but we're doing an event in miami with ghost ananaka on july 23rd raw banaka ghost and we're having some raw \nmanaka collab shorts there's three different shorts i believe we're doing with them and they're only gonna be on sale at the event you gotta go there to get it we're gonna the event's gonna be free because we just wanna have people come \nbut there's separate tickets to come see\nme we're charging with those but they're we're donating all the money to charity and the reason we're doing that just because last time we had an event two thousand people came and they all came and wanted to see me at some point or whatever and the line for me was just grueling and there were just people waiting forever and it almost wasn't fair to them i was also dying by the end of the day so we limited the amount of people that are guaranteed to see me at the event tickets will be separate you'll see me in group of c-bomb will be on the website \nand then the other tickets are free to come the event we're going to have exclusive merch a knock we'll have exclusive merch will be free energy drinks from ghost energy these shorts are going to be there bunch of t-shirts a bunch of cool stuff so put the link down below you can check that out tickets are probably almost sold out i haven't looked at the update recently but july 23rd it's in miami so you can come would be cool \nbut yeah \nthat's it \nall right last meal \nof the day put this together very aesthetically so you can see it but i'm going to eat that in like 30 minutes watching tv probably but this is the meal also just so calvin doesn't have to wait in my house till midnight pretty much but last meal consists of 300 grams\npotato 180 grams of ground turkey probably gonna get some ketchup and sriracha you can buy that on here very delicious and then i have a little snack i usually either have one of these in the morning at night usually with my shake but i forgot to have it with my shakes i'm having it today just a simple little sandwich with some almond butter and so \nthat means \nmy total \ncalories for today are \none hundred and thirty three calories i think that's pretty attainable 460 grams of carbs 140 grams of fat 264 grams of protein so i think it's pretty \nconsistent i don't know if it's my old age \nor what but i feel like my metabolism is like slowed down in a sense or maybe my body's just used to putting on muscle mass a little easier because i haven't i've been doing it for more years but i used to eat like five six seven calories to look just like this now 4 100 \ncalories i'm totally putting on weight right now so can't complain about that a little bit easier to eat and i'm \nactually able to not like feel sick eating my meals \nso this is where we're at right now i'm gonna keep eating like this consistently let me keep weighing myself pretty much every single day and tracking it and my weight doesn't increase \nat all in like two to three weeks i'll\nadd like 500 calories 13 4 500 to 4 600. the person that's how i do i give myself like \ntwo to three weeks when i see no game switch it add some food and then if i put on too much weight bring it back down but i probably won't so \nyeah that is a wrap on \nthis full day of eating thank you guys for watching don't be a skinny [ __ ] get huge eat lots the food enjoy oh i did want to mention people always ask like oh if you're natty can you eat like this if you're taking stuff and you eat more essentially no it's more off body mass and lean lean body mass i should say so if you have i know it's really not \npossible but if you're 250 same body fat as me but not taking stuff \nhypothetically you could eat the same work so it doesn't matter whether you're taking stuff and you're natty or not it just matters what your body weight is when your lean body masses so if you're 200 380 pounds and you're taking stuff or you're not the same amount of body mass lean body mass you could eat the same and get away with it taking stuff not being naughty doesn't just magically allow you to absorb more food your body starts to digest it just allows you to have a better recovery and affinity put on muscle quicker so yeah obviously if you're not 250 250 260 don't eat this amount i'm just showing you guys ways to eat little tips and tricks along the way but you guys have to lessen the food\ndepending on your caloric needs and take all that stuff so yeah but you guys watching \nsee you next video"

    "text": "CBum ? Triceps Tips & Tricks (Episode 2) ? Transcript \nCompiled by ChatGPT ? 2025-11-01 08:06 \nwhat's going on guys Chris bump said here is episode number 2 for my little tips and tricks series today I'm going to be giving you guys 3 exercise lungs a little advice on building bigger triceps all right so first exercise we're gonna start here in the cables always like warming up my triceps and the cable it's just gonna get your elbows a little warm this one's really good for like a tricep activation because what we're gonna be doing is starting with the cable at the top here and you're gonna be finishing the movement behind you back here I'm that really light contraction here at the back is a really good activation beginner for your tricep yeah if you think about the deepest part of the stretch and your bicep is back here that's gonna mean the tennis contraction is also back here for your tricep because they're in taking these muscles so during this exercise you're gonna want to start grab the cable machine and take a few steps back personally I like to do it with no attachment on you if you want you can use one end of a rope or handle whatever it's easiest for you to hold on to you're gonna wanna start bring your elbow down by your side you want to lock in your traps lower your shoulder so messing up here it's moving up or down at all it's all stable right here you're just gonna drive the weight down and really focus on the tape squeeze at the back and control the way back up a great finisher for this exercise - is take a few steps forward once you go to failure at the back and once you're underneath is the strength curve will change and it gets a little bit easier right here as you're driving straight down it's a bit less of a contraction but you have more power so you can finish out a few more reps for this exercise because it's normally the first one I do in a workout I'll normally do two or three warm-ups just to kind of get everything going blood flowing into the elbow and just make sure you're nice and warm and then from there and we one two but three working sets and on the last set I'll perform that little job that you saw all right step forward and I finish out there for rep range you're gonna want to aim a little bit on the higher end because like I said you're focusing on such a tight contraction you're not gonna be super strong down there so you want to keep the weight low and really focus on squeezing at the bottom so aim for around 12 to 15 reps moving on to exercise of numero dos this is gonna be the compound movement and I like to put this for triceps kind of in the middle of the workout that's why we're doing a second for this we're gonna be performing a skull crusher with a barbell or EZ bar I personally like to use an EZ bar because that little angle in the bar helps me get in a better position and this exercise are two kind of variations you can do it and you'll see people are there normally lowering the weight behind their head or kind of right to the forehead like crush from their skull as the names called and the more your elbows are forward and you're lowering kind of down to your face that's gonna hit the lateral head of your chest head more and then the more you kind of break it behind your head is a deep stretch that's gonna be hidden the long head here on your tricep personally I'm trying to grow my arms to be like just have a hang specially want to hit a front double biceps so I want when I hold my arm out here I want this like draw so I'm focusing more on the long head so I'll be focusing on bringing it back further and getting a bit of a deeper stretch I like to perform this exercise on an inclined bench because again about that stretch it helps\nyou kind of get it back a little farther and to be completely honest easier to lie back to an incline than a full flat bench start with the bar directly above your head so your elbows are perpendicular with the floor you want to control the weight lower it slow get that deep stretch behind your head and then drive up for this exercise because like I said this is the compound movement of the other side this is a except where you can definitely add a little bit more weight if you want to go heavy kind of bump up how much you can go you want to aim for six to eight rep range that's kind of like that's really making a compound heavy movement I like to do anywhere between six and ten reps depending on like the goal of that workout or how I'm feeling my elbows are good if I'm feeling strong whatever I just aim between that six 10 rep range and again because we're going a little heavier it's good to do it like that one or two warm-ups just to make sure you're feeling the way you feel uncomfortable everything's moving out it should be and perform three working sets so for the third and final exercise we're gonna move back to the cables because this is just really my favorite place to be when I'm training arms and the goal and a lot of my workouts is to hit every muscle from every angle you can because we began the workout what's a really take contraction at the back behind you and in the middle we have the opposite which was at a stretch at the top here we're gonna do a little bit in the middle of that range of motion here we're gonna perform a little bit of variation to the regular tricep pushdowns you're gonna want to grab the bar you go to seat from the cable machine pull it down and you're gonna start with your elbows pointing straight down at the floor first rep you just drive straight down and then when you bring it up the next time you're and it comes slowly here and raise your hands up a little bit and you're letting your elbows to fall forward this range of motion right here is focusing a lot on the long head of your tricep like I said the meaty part of it right here and the final part is a movement where you're pressing down there's gonna be more of the lateral head so you raise it up slowly up down you want to try to control this as much as you can to not use any motion to push the weight down [Music] a great finisher for this exercise to is just to do that beginning part of the movement right when you're done and you can't do any more rep pushing down just use that last part pulling this along into your tricep and we'll get a serious break on this one too because it's your last exercise you can kind of cheat it out a little bit and just train completely deplete the muscle so say you fail on this rep here you'll bring it up and then you just focus on this rapier this morning trust me finishing off your chest if I said like this will get you a crazy pop so because the cable movement and it's not a whole lot of stress point on the joint if you feel super warm you're sweaty you got a pump you really don't need to warm up on this and I'll typically perform three to four working sets depending how I feel at the end of my workout I feel like I have one more and me I'll add one and on that last set maybe even two of them that's one I'll add that little finisher like I told you you just really want to bang this out and completely go till failure until your arms are just swollen pumped up like crazy and you're just done the word go alright so those are my three current favorite exercises for training tricep gets every kind of range of motion you got a stretch the contraction a little bit of mid-range motion and a burnout at the end so if you guys like this exercise you've tried it let me know what you think in the comments below any more videos you guys want to see from me let me know hopefully you gather have a good workout building some meaty triceps and if you liked the video please like the video and remember to subscribe"

Push/Pull/Legs Program (Transcript) \nSource: user-provided transcript \nuh \n[Music] \nwhat is up youtube so today i want to \ntalk to you guys about how i've been \ntraining my training program from the \ntypical bro split to the push-pull legs \nand it's been a bit of an experience for \nme it's been actually kind of hard \nbecause i've been so rooted in how i \ntrained for so long so it's almost been \nfun to switch things up and see how to \ndo it and change my program around so \ni'm going to show you guys kind of \ndifficulties with me why i think \npushbull likes potentially better but \nit's not the end all bl \nand i'm gonna leave you with my exact \nprogram too at the end everything i've \nbeen doing throughout the week training \nsets exercises everything like that so \nif you guys want to skip to that go \nahead skip to that but for now \ni want to talk about kind of my process \nof switching over so obviously bro split \nis training each body part once a week \nor every five days depending on how much \nrest days you take just training chest \narms shoulders back legs repeat go \nthrough that push-pull legs \nself-explanatory as well push is chest \ntriceps shoulders pull back biceps legs \nobviously glutes quads hams calves don't \nforget to train your damn calves because \ni've seen they can grow if you train \nthem they will grow i promise just \nmaybe not as quick as everybody else but \nthat's not the point we'll make another \ncalf training video because i've been \nloving training calves a lot lately \nbut back to the push pull like three \nteam a big reason this has become so \npopular with before a lot of people saw \nit as something for beginners because \nit's a lot more simpler process to \nfollow if i'm i know even my parents \nwhen they were kind of asking me what \nthey could do in the gym they only get \nin there a couple times a week whatever\nmy dad i think he was saying he could i easily go three times a week so i was like easiest way to do it push pull legs kind of take care of everything throughout the week being in in there an extra time and just kind of do some cardio stretching abs do whatever you can that's awesome \nbut it's become a lot more popular overall in the entire fitness community at elite levels even now because of the frequency in which it allows you to train so a lot of studies and findings have been showing that the most optimal way for muscle growth is to train a body part more than once a week the studies have been shown because of the protein synthesis it increases so that's the hard work for me to say with a dry mouth synthesis i'm going to try and avoid that but when you train a muscle obviously you're breaking it down you're increasing protein synthesis and then when it builds back up that's how it grows that's how you get a bigger muscle so when you hit that muscle it's a chest or whatever protein synthesis has increased for like 48 hours and a lot of studies have actually shown the more elite training you are it actually is that window decreases so it could go down to like 24 hours or 36 hours or whatever depending on how well trained you are \nand then from there you're kind of not really building anymore you but you you can recover if you're so broken down like you've beaten something up but you're really not growing other than within that period so obviously if that's only two days a week where you're growing and then you train it once and then you'll train that body for another five days or seven days even on the bro split obviously that doesn't seem as optimal as if you could train it on monday and then again on friday or thursday however your split is organized and you kind of get a lot more benefits out of it \nthis obviously means that because you have more frequency you need a little bit less intensity or volume in each workout because if your overall goal is to hit a certain amount of sets in a week and before you're hitting a youth\nchest again let's say 12 to 15 sets in a chest day \nnow if you're doing that twice a week that's going to be up doubling your volume to 30. obviously your body's not really going to be able to recover from that it's kind of going to lead to injury and just a lot of pain and you don't want that so what you got to do is split it up and be a lot more smart and this is where i personally struggled because i love getting in the gym and just like hauling ass just pushing everything to the limit training as hard as i can to not be able to lift my arms up and i'll walk up the stairs at the end of a leg day whatever it is i just like being able to kill myself \nand learning to not do that was hard so initially when i was doing it i was doing very similar chest workouts the way they were and i was adding shoulders adding triceps and then i would do it again three days later and i was sore i was tired and my body started to just like feel shitty so like okay obviously you're not uh \nwolverine can't recover like a crazy animal so i had to adjust in ways and push myself a little bit harder do less volume in each workout and it's been an adjustment but i've actually started to like it because mentally it kind of allows me to realize again on the chest thing instead of hitting 12 sets in a workout if i only have let's say six maybe eight two total exercises of chest on that day i know in those two exercises i have to give my 100 full effort just kill those or else i'm not getting any benefit from the workout there's no like make up for it halfway through or whatever so it pushes me in those workouts and that's still not too much should be broken down four days later and i can hit it again then another obvious benefit because you're not doing all those sets in one single workout \nat the end of a workout typically if you're training one body part for an hour an hour and a half like some crazy people by the end of that workout you really don't have a lot of intensity left to give you don't have any energy the muscle's depleted it's broken down\nand it's just kind of tapped out of all the work it can do but you're still pushing it to get all that volume in one day so your last few sets are kind of a waste so if every single chest say you come in and you bench you incline back to back maybe so that's like \nsix maybe eight sets of just pressing and then you move on to flies at the end of your chest day a lot of those flies are kind of negligible you're not getting the amount of work you could be in out of them now putting the same amount of density you could as if you split it up so now if you have two chest days in a week and the way i like to kind of split it up is having like a press day like bench press and stuff like that and later on the week you do a little bit more flies you're getting best of both worlds you're able to push yourself in the bench press at the beginning as well push yourself in the flies and you're getting a lot more intensity out of the same amount of sets same amount of volume so another huge benefit of push-pull legs as any routine obviously you can organize it however you want a lot of people like to just do push pull legs rest push pull legs repeat they do the same workout so they have three workouts and that's all they do \npersonally i wanted to have six workouts make it a little bit more complex and shake \nrest days off when i felt they needed it so i don't really have like every single week i'm twitching through or whatever it's more like i do push pull legs and then if i feel \nfired up i'm ready to go i'm not sorry the next day i'll just get right back into it and if in between push pull i need to rest before legs i'll rest before legs say it's squat day or something that day so it's really important to kind of know your body and put the rest in where you want it's not like concrete \nnot only that a lot of people think you need to do push pull then legs you can do legs push then pull \nor whatever way you want to organize it whatever way feels best for you works because obviously a benefit of push-pull\nlegs is you're not really training the same body part \nback-to-back days whereas if i'm doing chest one day shoulders the next day triceps the next day i'm kind of hitting my triceps three days in a row something at some point when you're training each body part once a week is going to be getting hit back to back it's kind of impossible i tried for years to organize my split so that either on back day if i was doing rack pulls it wasn't close to leg day because my hamstrings or lower back would be sore chest day wasn't before shoulder shoulders the one before chest whatever and it was impossible to organize push-pull legs kind of takes all that thought out of it and allows you to hit it all in one day and move on to a pull whatever legs the next day and personally i really like that so back to organizing how you want to organize your split like i said i have six total workouts so i do push pull legs push work at one pull workout one leg workout one and then rest if i need it or whatever and then i do repeat obviously push workout two pull workout two leg workout two and i i had to organize this on a computer and the first time i have had to do this for myself because i've been training so long and i just like to train how i train and writing it all down organizing it and then i went to the gym and tried a few times and like i said i just put down too much volume for each body part and i was just getting hurt more than recovering like i needed to so i switched it up and i'm going to try and read through my program and put it up on the screen we're going to see how my editing skills go because i am not an i.t guy my dad was a computer science genius but did not get that trait so on the first start i went with the typical organization of a push-pull leg for push day one \nfirst exercise is barbell press incline or flat personally i like incline a lot more but i do like to put the flat in sometimes to switch it up \nand on this chest day i have a heavy press movement and i want to focus on keeping a little bit of my strength right now because i've been\ntake i took some time off the gym i haven't really been eating a lot i've been giving my body and digestion my autoimmune everything a little bit of a break so i want to kind of have some strength \nso everything i have a \nheavy heavy press and i'll have a heavy squat in the week and focus in on where i want it but i'll get to that leg day after that i have alternated dumbbell shoulder press so this is something i started to do a lot lately where you do one arm at a time and it gets a little bit of core in the way but it just allows you to really focus on each arm and perfect every rep \nand i personally find even because you're doing one at a time you can kind of push out even a couple more reps and just get a little more intensity because you're just focusing on one arm at a time instead of two \nafter that i got a superset chest flies with tricep extensions so you'll see i have three sets of the flies and then four sets of the extensions and that's because we've been starting off with chest earlier in the workout so i'm gonna add in a little more triceps in that superset then got lateral raises my all-time favorite exercise for shoulders a lot of raises just always do them \nand then dips at the end that's another thing where i never knew where to put it into my workouts because i was like well dips hit my chest and my triceps have been in my front delt like what what day should i do it on if i'm gonna get my chest or triceps or whatever so now finishing off at the end goat's all failure just kind of hammered a lot of volume here at the end for pull day one i mean i out another reason i mean i have another reason \nso for pull day one another reason i really like this routine is pull days for me is my weak body part day so back and biceps are my two weakest body parts so on this day i know i need to get in there and i need to f [ __ ] up and fire through that workout whether i need some extra caffeine i definitely eat a little more extra calories some treats before the workout to get me fired up maybe\nsome sushi after just a good day and i just know this workout's got to be good and i bring all my intensities of my pull days but i start with pull downs if you've ever watched me train back i always start with that it's just a great way to kind of get the blood flowing get a good stretch in your spine lats everything just get a feel for \neverything start really light just focus on contracting the muscle \nand then i move over to bench over rows a little warm up and then move on to some heavy sets this will be the heaviest exercise for the workout uh bent over rows there's no beat in that exercise i think for back day that is my favorite like back thickness builder i really want to focus on having good form not having like a jerky movement anywhere in there you want to be able to have like at the top be able to slightly pause it and go down otherwise doing a little too much weight so many people like jerk to row and you're really just not getting the benefit out of it just a lower back hamstring glute workout at that point \nthen first bicep exercise is slight inclined seated dumbbell curls this is the best \nexercise for me personally i found that i need to do a lot lighter weight focus on contraction training biceps otherwise i just i can't get it my worth my muscle connection body part of my body so i keep it really light keep going incline constant tension on it and this exercise gives me a really good pump \nthen i move on to pull ups which is typically pretty hard after hammering out like when you get a pump in the bicep curls so that personally if i kind of go on my fingertips try to keep my loose hand my hand loose or i'm using straps it allows me to take my biceps a lot of the movement and probably only do like six or so reps so the failure really isn't that much volume \nthen you finish off with easy bar curls and you'll see in here i have at the end two sets of 40 seconds this is a new kind of like technique i've also been adding into my training where you literally put your phone down you turn a timer on and you start your set and you\nwant to keep constant tension on the muscle no quick just like moving good reps clean reps for 40 whole seconds and that's a long time you really don't think it i started doing it like literally no matter the weight i put it at when i started doing this i couldn't get past 35 seconds \nit was super light of course i could but like i knew i just my muscular endurance was not there and so doing this had i found really helped kind of \nbuild my muscle connection hammer at a bit more volume and get a good pump and just like focus on the contraction a lot more and just like \ni've been loving these sets a lot personally and we're gonna see if i see any benefit of it in the future so moving on to legs day one this is my leg day where i don't have squats in it because i wanted to have rdls or deadlift in this workout and in my next back day you'll see i'm doing rack pulls and i didn't want to back go back to back rack pulls and deadlifts so switch it into this direction \nfirst exercise though is lunges i've i do a whole warm up which i got to show you in my leg day videos they're all different but i just do a long like 15 20 minute warm up a bunch of exercises just high volume to kind of just get the blood flow in the body but when i start with lunges i love starting body weight like 10 15 steps each leg back and forth on the turf if you have it or down whatever alleyway you can find i find it's a great way to just like move the hips move you just you're moving you're getting the blood flowing it really warms up my knees which have been hurting a little bit lately in this cold weather just a great way to start every leg day \nand then i move on to some heavy weights but heavy but whatever you can get up to where you're still doing a lot of volume so 15 steps each leg i like putting the \nweight on my back personally instead of holding dumbbells but whatever you want to do works \nthen moving on to the rdl's or dead lift so this isn't going to be like a crazy thing for me because right now i still have a little bit of a hamstring pain so\nfor me this isn't like the typical deadlift where i'm going to burn myself out but it's just kind of like getting the movement in i found when i took deadlifts out \nand \nrdls because i hurt my lower back a little bit tore my hamstring and all that i saw a lot of deficit in my glutes and my hamstrings on stage this year and my squat ended up coming down and strength-wise because of it so i want to slowly incorporate that back in build that strength back up \nmoving on to hip thrust or kickbacks not always the funnest exercise for a dude to do but very beneficial your glutes are the powerhouse of your legs and a lot of guys neglect them so a little isolation here mid leg day then we're to move on to seated calf raises and you're going to notice i'm not doing it at the very end of my workout here and that's because i actually want to focus on growing my calves a lot so i don't want to just wait till the end of everything will work out and hammer them out doing a little bit before i'm going to do six sets because i love the seated calf raise and next like they were going to do standing cap raises but \nsee calf raises for me i just get a really good feel of it \nreally deep stretch at the bottom tight contraction at the top and i love these and so i'm going to do six sets of that 10 12 reps for high volume in the last \nfour sets i'm actually going to super set with the next exercise that's going to be the line hamstring curl \nor whatever hamstring curl just like the lying hamstring curl the best you can start with two sets eight to ten reps and then again i'm going to do that two sets of the 40 second sets and this one is really hard and why i like doing the lying ones i put my phone on the floor with the timer and i get my head locked in and you're looking down on your phone and i like look away for like a while and like not look at my phone and i think i'm at like 40 seconds i look down here at like 25 30 you got another 10 to go \nso that's i really like these sets like i said they kind of force you to bring a\nlittle bit more intensity and kind of hammer out those last few reps really focus on like slowing the rep down because you'll find if you're going really quick you are not lasting 40 seconds so every rep's got to be pretty slow and controlled and \ntrying to waste time pretty much so for push day two now we're on to the second round of the workouts so obviously push pull legs around one now we're on to \nround two whether you take a rest in between or like i said a rest before back day for me because back the weak point wherever you want to put it you put it i put it where i feel that's why i didn't even write rest down anywhere in my routine \nso push day two we're gonna be starting with a close grip bench press so this one i try and focus a little bit more on hamstrings of course chest is gonna activate a little bit but again that's another benefit of training triceps chest on the same day doesn't matter if one if they're both working that's a good thing \nso start with close curl bench press three working sets and then we're going to move on to standing barbell press this is a movement i've been liking to do a lot lately i used to always just do it seated and just try and hammer it out and i can go heavier when i'm seated but i really think i'm activating a little bit more chest and i like the the core engagement standing brings just the overall like form making me feel more athletic too so i've been doing standing by our pedal press then we'll move on to pec deck flies \nlove the pec deck this thing is just like if you want just pure pec \ncontraction i don't think this can be beat just locked in the machine here again we're doing that two sets of 40 seconds and this is be the first pec really like dominant exercise in the workout or like isolation i said but it gets you a really good pump doing that two sets 40 seconds so good to put that in right in the middle next we're gonna move on to the overhead tricep movement it doesn't really matter what whatever your favorite one is but i think every tricep\nroutine throughout the week you got to have something behind the head like this where you're getting a really deep stretch coming through good contraction at the top overhead tricep movements are just something you do not want to neglect to get that really deep stretch grow those juicy triceps \nthen we're going to move on to lateral raises like i said favorite shoulder workout before we're doing it twice in the week and any form of push-ups so first four sets you're going to do the lateral raises 10 to 12 reps and then you're gonna move on to push-ups till failure personally i like doing them on like a bench where i can like hold something like this and as i'm holding it i like push in and kind of like a close grip and it allows me to really contract my packs like really hard because you're holding onto a bench let's say and pushing it together it gets a really good contraction and you just kind of hammer out the volume in your chest at the end of your last push day for pull day two we got pull-ups at the beginning three sets kind of get the blood moving and i'm going to do this while i'm warming up with my rack pulls for the next exercise so pull-ups are something i've been incorporating a little bit more now because i finally like a skill exercise and no matter how many pull downs you do it does not translate over to pull ups pull ups just like the og back workout it's a really good way to kind of build my muscle connection as well and i neglected them for a long time because i just like pulled down so i'm trying to put them in a little bit more now and just get better at them \nand like i said because in my gym where i have like power racks or whatever so i'll do pull-ups and then i'll go down and just below i'm gonna warm up on my rack pulls get my lower back warmed up and we only have two working sets of the rack pulls like i said i don't want to tax my lower back too much and start engaging too much like glued hamstring on these so i'm going to really focus on just pulling in through the lower back two working sets eight to ten reps see how heavy we can get but again i haven't\nbeen doing any pulling movements like that because of a few injuries so ease back into that \nmove on to hammer curls here three sets twenty ten to twelve reps \nagain switching up all the different kind of exercises throughout the week i want to get some kind of either reverse grip or hammer curl so i could alternate those in the set here but you want to kind of get some that's going to hit your brachialis a little bit more that's my that's what i believe the secret for phil he's trying arms he has the crazy biceps too but they look so freaky because his brachialis just fills out his arm and i got a short little bicep so i gotta do whatever i can \nnext we gotta reverse grip row or pull down so this has been lately a favorite exercise of mine something you don't want to go too heavy because your wrist can honestly kind of hurt but then you want to focus on just like pulling in the right direction not with your biceps but either \na pull down row reverse grip and really focus on pulling down with your elbows in front of your body rather than like pulling kind of into your face with your biceps and when you get this movement right i think it can be really \nbeneficial to building your back after that we got cable curls uh either one aim one arm two arm cables it's just a great thing to have an unarmed day for that constant tension it's a great way to hammer out some reps and get a really good pump \nthen we're gonna finish with dumbbell curls this is just one set i used to do this all the time in college because we had the giant rack of black dumbbells never really many people in the gym so hopefully that's not too busy when i do this but started a weight where you can do like maybe \nsix reps each arm whatever like 40s maybe for me not too heavy and then go close to failure not quite and then just keep going down and i'm probably going to do \nhowever much i feel like really maybe four sets just kind of a big drops at the end of the workout but only once and then you're done so moving on to the\nfinal workout leg day number two this is going to be my squat day so like i said i do want to keep a little bit of strength in so i have three warm up sets or however many i need i just put that in randomly sometimes i don't know why i put up warm ups then three sets eight ten reps and we're gonna have one set where i go a little bit heavier so i really like to i can actually push myself through a few sets like maybe however many reps i go through and then finally for my last set i put on a little bit more and i go really heavy and it just allows me to like not really feel sketchy about injury or whatever it might not be able to lift as much as possible but it makes me feel warm safe and \ncuddly my little blanket next we're going to do a leg press superset with calves again doing calves at the beginning of the workout because i'm trying to get huge caps so it's gonna be this is a not a fun like presto that's pretty i'm sure you're doing two sets 40 second sets like i've explained earlier and you really really want to keep just constant tension on the muscle and just go as heavy as you can and just try and hammer them out and just get blood pumped into them i know when you're keeping your legs up like that and you're just constant on the leg press sometimes you get a huge pump it's just debilitating and feels amazing and superset \ni love doing calf raises on the leg press so maybe i need to drop a couple plates off or whatever and then hammer them out in between sets and just however heavy you can go until failure aim for over 10 at least and then just like hammer them out \nand move on to the hip adductors this is the squeeze in one the good girl exercise and this is something i've been putting into every single leg day for a while \nand \nthey just i felt like my squat was kind of like my knees were caving in i had my groin felt super weak and i had really strong quads and powerful like legs but i felt weak my knees were kind of starting to hurt i started to implement\nthis a lot it actually helped my squat a lot my like stability felt a lot better and just my knees started to hurt less everything just kind of flowed better so you want to make sure you're not kind of neglecting the abductors abductors parts of your leg \nnext we're moving on to standing calf raises \nlike i said we've done seated we've done light press now we're doing standing training huge calves not lying about that \ndo four sets 10 to 12 reps and then bounce reps to failure \neveryone obviously knows that it was that is you focus on your deep stretch contraction at the first few and then when you start to get too tired stay at the top of the rep and just bounce as much as you can get some blood flowing in there and just finish off the calves finally we're gonna move on to quad extensions and we're gonna do two sets at the beginning 10 to 12 reps whatever and then you're going to do two sets of triple drop set so start at whatever your weight was the beginning go immediately drop the weight down once drop the weight again rest and repeat and i've always found hammering out a couple of drop sets of quad ascension at the end which is just like \na perfect way to just flood blood into the leg and kind of finish them off obviously i don't think anyone's ever heard \nanybody say that they attribute having big legs quad extensions but definitely helps a little isolation fine tuning movements at the end you get your squat at the beginning lunges earlier in the week so you're getting everything you need \ni guess that's it \nthat's my current training program and like i said i might have to change stuff it might be a little too intense it's not enough depending how you feel everyone's going to be different the level of which you're at how quick your body can recover etc etc depends how much volume and intensity you can handle throughout the week so this is \npersonally something i've been trying i've obviously been training for a long\ntime and my life is pretty much rest recovery eat and train so it allows me to push pretty hard throughout the week but you can see i have a great variation of all the different exercises \nthroughout the week trying to hit every body part at different angles different exercises different rep ranges and all that good stuff so it really is push-pull legs is really like a interesting kind of routine that allows you to just like \nstructure things in a very intelligent way i find very specific way whereas with growth but it's just kind of like hammer yourself hurt yourself throughout the week see how hard you can train and then move on and i don't want to like down talk bro split because i found a lot of people have now that push-pull legs and training frequency increasing have become more popular obviously bro slow works it worked for me it works for a lot of people and i think the most important thing in finding the right training program for you is making sure it's just that for you \nso for the longest time i did push the bro split and i absolutely loved it i loved getting in the gym training hard leaving tired hurt and it made me feel super accomplished and that made me excited to go to the gym made me excited to push myself and i saw great results because of that i could have been doing something more optimal probably but if it was more optimal like let's say the most optimal way to train with full body every single day i would hate that and i just wouldn't want to get in the gym i wouldn't feel motivated i wouldn't be pushing myself when i was in there and i would actually see less results so the most important factor is finding what works best for you what you want to do because at the end of the day \nmost of us are in great damn shape and we're not here just to like be healthy lose weight and just like suffering in the gym we're here because we want to be \nwe enjoy it we love what we're doing and we want to also see the results so make sure you're not doing a program just because i'm doing it someone you look up to do and someone said it's the best make sure it's what's best for you\npersonally you're gonna enjoy it and \nyeah so \nhopefully you guys like this video i kind of hammered through that really quick \nand \nhopefully it made sense in what i was saying but if you guys won't have any questions comment below i'll try and go through them as best as i can \nand \ni'll also want to do a series kind of where i train push pull legs push pull legs each workout i have and i explain each exercise each workout and i'm maybe going to try and put that into a little series or whatever on youtube so hopefully that can come out after this video you guys can see everything i've been doing and i can give you my tips and tricks on it and maybe i'll be switching up my routine throughout and you guys can kind of learn from my mistakes because i've already made a lot in this like i said i've hammered out a few workouts and was pushing too hard and three days later went into train chest again and \nwas way too sore so you guys can learn from my mistakes and beat that learning curve that my goal is accomplished but yeah hopefully you guys like this video if you did remember like the video and please subscribe \nsee you next time"

    "text": "Transcript ? High Carb Day, Leg Day & Recovery Vlog \nGenerated on November 03, 2025 \nwhat is up YouTube living life right now high carb day that's not my meal though sadly that's not on diet but this is the new Savage Bowl ground bison sweet potato hash avocado Mayo mix with ketchup and mustard like Big Mac Secret Sauce delicious and we got beautiful new six-pack boxes for the bum box so Calvin's eating like a champion and I'm trying to be a champion so with that being said I do have a little bit of a higher carb day today we're rolling and prep it's pretty much rolling with the punches going with the flow as things are especially at this point we're 2 and a half weeks out right now so I typic I don't typically I send honey my weight every single morning maybe every other day every three days I send a check-in in the morning every now and then I check in after my workout and given how flat I look how much my weight's dropping it all depends on what I'm going to eat that day so I have a base diet which right now is a little bit less than that full day evening I think I'm down to like 180 of carbs a little bit maybe just sub 2,000 calories or so with my base diet and my weight dropped like a pound 2 days in a row so we're like all right eat a little bit more food and see how your body responds to that plus it's leg day today so I'm getting a little bit more nutrients in me but it's nothing crazy it's like instead of 50 grams of carbs in a meal I get 75 gam of carbs get steak pre-workout I get salmon before bed so a little extra fat little extra carbs a little extra fun stuff but this is the thing H used to give me [ __ ] for saying everything that I did in my prep and everything we did and how I ate and all all this stuff and I was like it doesn't matter because there's no [ __ ] plan that someone else can follow and do this it's all just nuanced going with the flow reading how the body follows understanding what my body's done in the past how it's changing this year and all these things and just making adjustments as we go so you really got to learn your body over time have a coach who knows what the [ __ ] he's doing and adapt as time comes so with that being said I got to make my pre-workout meal you're not a fan of macros I'm not a big fan of if if it's your Macros in bodybuilding prep because the more you can control every single variable then you change one variable and you know what that change does whereas if you're getting different nutrients different sugars different sodium levels all these different preservatives all this [ __ ] in random food or your body doesn't know how it's going to digest even potato versus rice when you're eating at certain times a day it just changes things and you don't know what different potatoes different potatoes there's the rhyen reason behind all the potatoes but yeah I like eating the same thing every single day so I know exactly how my body responds and when I make a change I know what the change is causing so I atat the same thing every day but if I wasn't prepping to be Mr Olympia would I do If It Fits your Macros no but I would eat healthy If It Fits your Macros so if I wanted to have like healthy banana bread instead of rice one day I would just do it cuz I don't give a [ __ ] I'm not trying to win Olympia but I'm trying to win a six Olympia so we're locked in was that technique implemented where Courtney put your chicken in bong beginning of this prep I think I I think it started as convenience cuz it's easier to slow cook like 10 packs of chicken at once than anything else and it ended up tasting really good I enjoyed it it stayed fresher longer stayed moist longer if I'm allowed to use that word in the fridge and then it tastes good to reheat so pretty much all my chicken these here has been slow cooked and it's a BM broth and # delicious not as good as\nsteak though can't deny that all right love you bye bye by right there's definitely protein powder in that funnel that I just put a y in but that's all right we'll have some I think it was may have been the Frosted animal Frenchie cracker protein and some watermelon EA delicious intro all right I'm moving really slow today but those extra carbs are giving me energy I can feel it so I'm GNA try and move some weight today probably the last second last properly heavy leg day it's hamstring dominant not quad so nothing crazy but still try to keep the weights up heavy today not be skin pitch sh well the carbs are certainly working today amazing what extra 100 gr of carbs 15 20 G of fat can do still tired but I feel just much stronger taking advantage of it a [Music] the right God damn it this is too much work loading this machine up shouldn't have done this a little tight on the groin m [ __ ] [ __ ] this machine I'm too tired to get out of it [Music] least they playing good music today h [Music] ah [Applause] [Music] kind of sad they don't have the milk and cookies eiel protein here [Music]

mil exactly M up no same thing is every day one scoop milk and cookies one scoop dark chocolate you got to try cookies and cream can't break the tradition right now I'm a big dark chocolate guy maybe next time we'll see not after like [Music] day look at that Precision exactly two cups a [ __ ] protein Barista huge [Music] after you're done me you or I know how warm you feel how stiff you feel a little bit it it remember how everything works I've never used this thing no what e up I don't know if this here well Wellness right now taking care of myself there a little bit of spinal decompression the spine gets super locked up and when it gets tight I'm just getting old and I can't rotate so I can't hit my poses I can't hit my side chest my quarter 3/4 back double and everything so in here so I'm so loud behind my head trying to warm up my back going to go do the spinal neck decompression I shouldn't take care of my body on a rest day because don't want to fall apart and it's thr L time so stay tuned [Music] ready yeah that good to start or finish with sorry I said is that good to start or finish with you good for a nap yeah it's like an intro to a nap you know ler a little what um what were you last time remember or we want to go easier this time right I I don't remember she started off at like like half my body weight and then I was like I don't feel it do more do more and then I pushed myself up a little bit and then it did a lot yeah okay I was kind of pushing myself too much you about what 230 240 right now 250 250 okay so you want to you want to do like one 10 just to see how it feels like with yourself like locked in pretty good cuz we can always bump it up I don't want to do too much we start like 115 so okay just do yeah 115 just let's see how it

we 27 275 lbs on stage so rock and roll but no seriously the machine actually helps a lot I need to do it more but it's just time consuming so cep it's just all about taking care of my body when I actually do it now it's rest day pull my SPID apart going lie here I got really sick of listening to podcasts that were like self-help or education or science or learning or health so listen to [ __ ] The Witcher right now I'm just zoning out and hopefully fall asleep wish me Lu I just going to say you feeling anything yet totally coming okay just like itch me down a [Music] bit how's it going good

molding in there oh [beep] that's just blowing and you're like because honestly yeah since last year at all it literally I don't think I had allergies I think it was the mobile phone I don't think you do anything because when you came down the first time was when they hit me really bad yeah yeah so we're gonna break up little pieces of glass and we're gonna put it in his shoes when those cardios here if I won an Olympia living in [beep] mold last year I couldn't breathe couldn't sleep this guy's a little bit this year you know he jinxed it and then he'll be happening we can make you do back

good job put your back tighten up your legs ready pull back hold up you feel a little bit of blood in there yeah quarter turn good should I just do the wrong quarter turn this here just just to give everybody a little I don't know why not just make up a new version of it just have your arms so far away from your body what would you if I did that on Stick would you get up and leave I would take my shoe off and throw it see all that [beep] all the Drake concerts of girls throwing bras at him yeah we got some girl just threw a bra at him at a Drake concert and then Playboy like hired her as a model or something and I shoot and then another girl through her bra and it was like a 32j or something yeah some giant says really he like picks it up he's like 32 Jay like someone find this woman right now that's it that dude's [beep] hilarious that's got some back problems probably I don't even know what that number means it's not even the higher the letter the bigger the boobs yeah the wiser numbers and letters 32 is like your waist it's like your waist it goes around that's the circumference across here so you want like a 20 Z no no because you're gonna be this wide you're gonna look like tits on the stick so you want something proportional 32 34 36 depending on how big someone's back is how tall they are I'm a 56. you probably are are you thinking you gotta ask the Geo Ram that's right shout out to Ram we're waiting for our suit jackets nice jacket little can we do another one here yes one more good three good go go go cool let's keep going to join don't don't okay oh wait hold it slow slow slow stretch okay he only spot me a little crooked well it's because I'm pulling on one side it's a little it's a little tough on that bar too it's gonna be asymmetrical oh you'll be you'll live no not CrossFit Pull-Ups didn't he tell you that he wants to switch yes snowboarding championship and everything else he's gonna be working on he said he's gonna start skateboarding during crap wrap you in bubble wrap put a helmet on you and wrap your whole body in the whole wrap I'd still\nhurt myself oh see I know I was like 271 last night after dinner I'm not going to do very many of these I know 268 right now well no if you drink water if I'm back close to 270. let's go see how you do it okay Cross Your Hands bend your knees more bend your knees more keep going keep going keep going keep going not bad actually I feel way more than I thought you're gonna do I thought you'd do like three I feel like I weigh 300 pounds wow you look like your girls 270 oh you are two seven prime directive is I'm gonna have to try to make a topical diuretic for your face that was my Prime director from your uh put on weight without [beep] these growing rub a little bit of topical fat burner on your face yep you're like wow he's 22 body fat but his face looks like he's six weeks now I wish people who have skinny facials are so lucky for that you have another spot what is there another spot you can do without hitting your head on that thing in that bar maybe the skull rack that won't fit this way right because that's too narrow let me know you can try it's just the grip is really smooth you're not going to have any doubt my grip string no yeah hook up hook grip good cross cross cross cross there you go good yeah let's go and then we need help to straighten out your legs a little bit when you start needing a little help yeah that's it that's it good job and that's how you spawn what because normally that's too wide but because of how wide you are it actually is probably right where you need to be yeah yeah so what we'll do is we're gonna start doing those on the beginning I honestly didn't think you would be able to do that many because that's just how heavy you are you know this is the heaviest you are every time you see me every time it seems you lift you're like always suppressed thank you for yelling work out when you're not around well no I forget that you actually used to be an open bodybuilder fair enough you had to win your throw card as an overall wouldn't you I just went overall you're the fifth place got a pro card Justin Rodriguez beat me but you never you never competed an open yeah no until this year about what I wanted secrets you never knew but when you were not here he was like 300 pounds and he just dropped 30 pounds Calvin is that what happened he did a water he did a water cut no what you don't know is the fact that he texted me and says I feel like I'm too good of a shape so I'm gonna make sure to become a fat pig by the time you get here did you say that yeah that's nice uh what we'll do is let's do a row start getting into that reverse grip that stuff that we were working on last year that's right thicken up that back that little lap so let's do a reverse grip then over row switch yes oh okay this whole Archer back control Slow Down slow down further that is it control perfect good that's it let me stop it or the other that's it and last together good job yeah you might go a little bit wider and let's just add a 25 don't go straight to another blade I started leaning forward a little bit further though instead of like pulling here when I do over here I come here pull a little further over my body some weaker obviously but it's a better contraction yeah that's okay just you guys have to make sure you stay arched especially if it's a heavier way before I was I wasn't doing straight legs and I couldn't do it I couldn't row bent over because I didn't have the stability and I started doing straight legs and then all of a sudden rowing became way easier when did you stop doing straight legs when I was traveling all that much oh got it okay come on Chris three four five six four good done good job [Music] good I'll go back a little tax from yesterday's leg day but yeah yeah well normally I wouldn't want you to do back after legs but because you want to concentrate on those machines and I mean the uh those workouts it made sense this time I normally do legs the day before when we did chest yeah but I had just done hamstrings the day before that so yeah it's better to do either chest or shoulders in between what about um overhand how do you feel about just keeping it at this weight and then going into an overhand I feel better about it sure okay let's do that because I just don't want too much pressure on your biceps right now I don't have any biceps really the string but I felt my biceps more in my back I probably have bigger biceps let's go Christopher let's go okay bring the elbows back a little further elbows back up that's it good good contraction excellent much better much better good stretches good job so when you're going early in the set you started bringing your elbows out this way and then the\nminute you start bringing your elbows in you can see a much better contraction going on but I agree okay where are you saying coming from averted but I used to do it purposely or more like trap upper back well because they feel that in yeah but we'll do trapping up her back when we do trapping up her back I know normally this is the rest of my workout two more lat okay we want to thicken up those laughs so those others know control the weight control the weight come on Chris boom elbows [Music] whoa control good good two more two more one more one more got this [Music] he almost broken don't do that 'll be fine that's fine oh it's fun it's broke I broke my back what's that mean I don't know some Mike Tyson breaking his back or something no one knows something like that no it's uh from that movie um The Longest Yard oh I think I broke it in my back yeah [Applause] mostly just all together what you've been doing on your because you've been traveling and all that [beep] like have you just I haven't been traveling recently well I mean for the last two or three weeks you haven't but before that you were traveling a lot so were you back for six weeks how do you think I'm so [beep] jacked right now this is jacked yeah okay um so have you been just doing a lot of the upper back with mid-back I'm doing mid and upper to my end and then on hamstring day I'll do like two lap purely lab focused exercise okay so have you been when was the last time you did when I'm done mother Rose [Music] definitely two are chest supported okay so let's do that so that you're obliques don't kicking so obliques because the way I pulled very similar no that's gonna pull higher yeah but that's what I'm saying I normally do barbell high for upper or dumbbell High forever not both what we're gonna do both we're gonna do one upper one lower a little bit stretch and pull excellent stretch pull good Drive dude you're actually a lot look stronger than you looking that's usually the goal I try and walk around look as skinny as possible okay make it harder up and hold it there you go come on pause itself pause stop good come on just a little longer good that's perfect pull good right there drop that [beep] on my feet go partials good one two keep going keep going three two that's it turn around I'm wearing the future himself and us any problems with hearing Oh I thought you're gonna say my toxic sarcasm that for sure is I don't have to ask about that one that's not good um [Music] hold up five seconds hold it good job good turn my labor I'm doing that doing it for our last friend yeah I've been practicing my Vacuums in my office got a small waist what are you getting signed by Dyson yeah I knew you're gonna say something like that I had to because there's got to be like a lead-in somewhere there's got to be a shitty joke somewhere yeah mine are less Shady videos maybe so but less shitty means about 20 sometimes okay let me ask you this um somebody overrides your [beep] what's that [Music] pull over pull over pull over on the machine I'll pull down is that thing I don't know a straight arm pull down is also this way full over action comment below it's a pull down or pull over say Chris is right it's a pullover Chris is always right [Music] [Music] [Music] instead of you pulling like this we're putting out here and it feels so much better yeah and also the best thing about it is that with the Canon equipment you can actually just change up the angle slightly so just changing up a little bit of that supination of the wrist can cause a lot better contraction [Music] good eight good full press good two Arch Arch Arch pretty good [Music] [Music] cool yeah [Music] good but let's keep the weight the same let's change up the angle what I want to do is we're going to feel a little bit of a variation did it feel for that feel the difference from the hand position yeah okay cool cool there you go good [Music] excellent keep going keep going [Music] Drive good it's like you're on stage you sound like you're on stage you're showing your Christmas tree oh that's it two more two more one more okay two parts two partials one more that's it good don't that one it's all about the girth [Music] three more foreign nice stretch did you raise the weight yeah no come on this [beep] [Music] and specify holy [beep] come on good oh stretch it stretch keep that core tight Drive good keep going keep going go [Music] good good just stretch and pull [Music] good [Music] go [Music] that's it a good stretch and stretch okay when you go up arch your back a little bit like that but keep your chest down but arch your back what does that mean s I'll show you go [Music]\nfull so what that means is as you're coming here to pull and you're just going here stretch but make sure you get your chest up a little bit when you stretch you told me to Arch my back without putting myself so if you arch your back but don't put your chest up no don't lean up too hot [Laughter] lift weights is all you know I take I pick up I put down now he's losing his brain cells on top of his hearing it's that mold I thought it was getting better too actually you probably are getting better it was rough for a while I actually had some serious brain fog for a while I mean you were like literally like had such a histamine reaction that you were just constantly like nose was all plugged up eyes were watery you travel you get better you go home and you're like oh my God no it sounds a lot better now helping your sleep helping your recovery that's good job good yep you're doing a good job of keeping your back arch good March [Music] scratch and pull that's it play your course you get a little bit good job good job one more set underwater stretcher like that stretch stretch stretch and cool excellent stretch press stretch Chris that's it bit back on stage let's go big back on stage let's go start good stretch up up up good two two straps one more [Music] pull pull good job excellent let's put some uh hypers get the lower back finished I look back it's like a pump full of blood you're like let's work on the lower back we're gonna just gotta do the hypers brother do about three sets of hypers four sets of hypers finish that off how's it feel good good you know I do a like a lower backish stay on my hamstrings too right yeah I'd rather just be here to do it so do you have a high percentage girls on it okay we'll go kick her off come on [Music] no these I need like a 600 pound deadlift for the Olympians you need it it'll boost my ego I pick up I put down what do you do for a living I pick up I put down that's it [Music] how I feel no just lower backwards this could be pumped what it's good to be pumped oh it's like knowing your spine's like really over Arch oh it's cramping yeah what happens stretch it a little bit and it's just not meant to be stretched [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] okay [Applause] just I just mixed some [beep] intro with protein and I don't know who did it but someone mixed the unflavored intro with flavored intro and now I'm drinking like lemon lime cookies and cream protein that's [beep] disgusting it's not good at all why don't you make some new new one it's a vodka it wasn't like five seconds ago I didn't want to waste it disgusting it's not like I own the company I can just get a Traeger tonight but too much work I want to try this I tried it and it wasn't good and now I'm just getting it down because they need it almost like sewage cookies and cream cookies and cream lemon lime okay for you or me for me my battery's flashing so you gotta three two one go battery slashing yeah okay so he stops no no I thought he's phoning at you all right guys got done day three we just got done doing an amazing back workout because we were able to get my muscle connection because it's all about time under tension and mind muscle connection and not just throwing around heavy stupid weight so you got to be really about it's got to be really smart about your training how'd it feel good form and then intensity that's right perfect form then you can add intensity yeah then you can add weight as you're able to get stronger instead of just trying to do it all backwards you go heavy your form's falling apart you're more likely to get hurt and you're not going to be able to grow so all you're trying to do now is assess where Chris is at for this prep and I think we need a really good job because you're in a good spot yeah no I feel good a lot stronger and bigger than I was last year going in the crap at this exact point you came down about 16 weeks out last year yep right when we started working through working the other yeah 15 16. so much better than last year yeah yeah you're heavier you're leaner you're stronger and I feel like it's a really good starting point getting ready to rock and roll yeah so now it's Max deadlifts what's that Max Douglas now it's about the max deadlift because Kelvin says it's about not stainless I just need a 600 pound one so we're looking for a new videographer by the way because Calvin's not gonna be able to do anything for six weeks you know so go ahead hit me up we're looking for a new videographer Calvin's gonna be injured reserved we're actually killing him but yeah that's a wrap on this three-part series thank you guys for tuning in we're gonna be heading to Dallas in x amount of\ntime that I will not tell you so no one finds me there but we'll be there eventually for some more training sessions so we'll get a few more H dub time sebum workouts coming in but yeah that's what's going on so peace out thank you guys for watching catch you later"

    "text": "Bulking ? Video Transcript \nSource: User-provided transcript \nPrepared on 2025-10-26 \nNotes \nThis document is a cleaned, formatted transcript based on the text you provided. Section headers were inferred heuristically from short title-like lines (e.g., questions such as ?How Do I Know When to Bulk??).\nIntro \nWhat is up, YouTube? Today, I'm going to be going over the top questions people ask me on how to bulk. Any questions I get towards bulking, I've kind of compiled in like a top 10, and I'm going to be going going over all of them today so you have them in a concise area pretty much based off my experience rather than just purely science-based stuff. It's everything I've done and learn from my mistakes throughout the years, so you guys can learn from what I've done right and done wrong and hopefully learn faster than I did. First \nHow Do I Know When to Bulk? \nquestion is always, how do I know when to bulk? And I find this such a funny question people ask me cuz I have no [beep] clue when people should bulk. It's very like situation dependent, person dependent, goal dependent. But as a whole, I would say obviously if your goals put on muscle, you should bulk. And if you're not fat, you can bulk. And fat is obviously very different to the average person. But if you're unhappy with the level of body fat you're at, that's super important. I don't think you should bulk yet. Come down to a body fat that you're happier with, maybe a little bit below even, and then work your way back up. But as a general rule of thumb, I like to be like around 12% body fat for men, maybe 18 to 20 for women, but having visible abs for men specifically, it's easier to gauge. So if my abs are still poking through a little bit, then I'm good to go and I know I haven't bulked too far or I'm good to bulk. Next question, tail off \nHow Do I Know When to Stop Bulking? \nthat last one, is how do I know when to stop bulking? And similar to when you know if you should bulk, if you start to lose your abs or if you get too much of a high body fat percentage, I always struggled to say that. I got it that time. Then you know it's time to slow down. There's a few other things like when your appetite is absolutely like in this [beep] like you can't eat at all. It'll be tough to eat when you're bulking really hard. One is completely gone. Sometimes you need to just take a step back. If your lifts in the gym are plateauing, if your weight is stagnating, all these different things, it's kind of time to give your body a little bit of a break, whether it be for a week or a full cut. It kind of depends on your goals and situation, of course. But again, big thing is if you have some abs, you're still happy with how you look, you're not too fat yet, then you can keep pushing that weight. All right. \nMacronutrient Essentials \nSo, how to start? How to start your base calories, macros, meal plan, whatever it may be. The simplest thing and that everybody needs to do in the suggestions quote is he always says what isn't measured isn't managed. So, the more you measure, the more you can manage, the more you can adapt and you know what changes you're making are causing the changes in your body. So, the most important step of starting anyone's fitness journey really is tracking everything you eat consistently and calculate the calories and macros on that. Maybe do it for a week, take the average and see what it is and weigh yourself during all those days as well. So, if I'm 250 lbs, I'm eating 4,000 calories every single day. Then my base to maintain 250 lb is 4,000 calories. So, if I want to lose weight, I'll go under that. If I want to gain weight, I'll go over that. Typically, you'll increase by like 5 to 10, probably like 5%, I would say. I usually go on more so like 300 to 500 calorie increase when I start a bulk. So, if I'm resting at 4,000, I'll go up to 4500. And then from there, you count your macros through that. Obviously, most important if\nPROTEIN \nyou're trying to bulk put on muscle is protein. And you don't need quite as much protein when you're bulking because carbs are actually protein sparing. When you're really low carb, your body is going to use protein for energy. Whereas, when you're really high carb, you have all the carbs to use for energy. So, your body uses the protein to build muscle. Therefore, they're like they help you spare protein. So, when you're in a low low carb deficit, your body's pulling from your protein source in order to make energy, not just rebuild. You need to add more protein to make sure that you're actually rebuilding properly as well as getting the energy from it. So, I stick to a minimum of 1 g per pound of body weight. Everyone knows that number. It's so simple. Just stick to it. Make sure you're at least hitting that. And that's what you prioritize. So, then you take that. I'm 250 lb. That's 250 g of protein with four calories for every gram of protein. So, multiply that by four. you're already at 1,000 calories. And then if I'm trying to hit 4,000 calories total, then I'm going to take 20 to 30% of that total caloric intake and make that into fat. And so whatever that is in fat, I'm not that quick at math. What is that? 20% of 4,000 200 800 800 quick math. So that would be 800 calories for me in fat. So then I have 1,000 calories of protein, 800 calories of fat, and then I just fill the rest with carbs. And then there's your macros right there. That's literally how simple it is. And the most important thing is to continue to track going forward. Make sure those are hidden with right. Track your body weight. Look at yourself in the mirror. Monitor your lifts. If things are moving in the direction you're happy with, just keep doing it. That's what's important. If you start to lose weight or you're not gaining weight fast enough, you add a little bit more calories. And then you keep those ratios the exact same. You can play with that. A lot of people do better with higher carb or higher fat. And you kind of rotate through. Typically, most people do that 20 30% fat. That's what's worked best for me. I enjoy eating a lot of carbs, not crazy amounts of fat, but also as I get to the end of my bulk and I'm eating like 6,000 calories, I'll start to just cover things in olive oil just because I need anything to get those calories in. So, obviously, there's a place to start, but the number one thing in being successful at anything is knowing that you're not stuck between these confines. If it works for you, it works for you. That's all that matters. Doesn't matter if someone else tells you what to do. If I do it or not, works for you, you're making muscle. The other thing to take note when you're counting your protein, the 1 g per pound of body weight, is there are some extreme cases where when people are really like underweight, like if you weigh 100 lb and you're a male and you're tall and you're just really skinny, you might want to bump that up from the beginning. And if you're heavily overweight, so you're 400 lb and you don't have that much muscle on you, you don't need 400 g of protein. If you can eat it, I guarantee you, you will lose weight more efficiently having more protein rather than fats or carbs in your diet. but it's not necessarily for putting on muscle. So, if it's too hard to eat, 400 grams of protein, that's a lot of protein, then bump that down to something that's a little bit more appropriate. What you would guess your lean body mass would be and then use that number. It's an estimate. Again, doesn't matter. You kind of play with things as they go. If you're really overweight losing weight, all that really matters is that your calories are below what your basil basil metabolic rate is. All right. Next question is \nWhat Type of Food Should I Be Eating? \nwhat type of food to eat? Cheat meals, clean bulk, or dirty bulk. Rule of thumb for this in my absolute belief is whole foods are the most important thing. Something that grows from the earth, something that caveman could eat, anything like that, single ingredient foods are your best bet. This is because I mean it's just normal food. Much easier for your body to digest. The more food you can digest and the nutrients you can actually absorb from it, the less you actually need to eat to get the same benefit out of it. The less you have to digest, better your stomach feels, the more\nyou can eat. It's all just like a feedback loop to making more gains essentially. And even eating bad food causes inflammation in the gut, which slows everything down, slows your bulk down, your muscle gain down, cause inflammation in your joints, can start hurting you when you're in the gym training. There's a cascade of effects that can come from that. Not to mention that it's just not as healthy for you. So, yes, we're trying to put on muscle, but the healthiest way to do it is often also the best way to do it. So, make sure you're actually focusing on eating clean whole foods and not just going after like a nasty, dirty goal. People \nWhat About Cheat Meals? \nalways ask about cheat meals. Why can I have cheat meal? I want a cheat meal. What's the point of cheat meals? All these things. And over the last like four or five years of my preps, I didn't get any cheat meals. And that was because of what I was talking about before. I didn't want that like gut digestion mess up. I didn't want the inflammation from it. I didn't want to ruin my sleep that night cuz I was full of all this [beep] and have my joints hurt the next day. Everything I was doing was so calculated to be the best that I was like, m I could have a cheat meal calorically and not get too fat, but it's going to have this other, you know, effects on my recovery, my digestion that's just not worth it right now. So, I didn't have those ever when I was in prep. In my off season, I like to live live a little bit. I still eat really healthy though. Like if I go to get a burger, sometimes I get a lettuce wrap, no cheese, cuz I know it's going to mess with my stomach and I make sure I stick with that. But again, it kind of depends on what your goals are. The only point of having a cheat meal is pretty much for your mental sake. If you need like a little bit of like stress relief or a break from it and if that's going to help you, then absolutely it's worth it. Even if you're a professional bodybuilder and it's going to benefit your mind and calm you down and give you a nice like cortisol brief to eat a cheat meal, then go for it. It's not the end of the world. But as me trying to be as the best in the world, I wasn't going to do that [beep] I was like, \"Fuck it. I'm going to fill up on good food, food I know I can digest, just eat more of that, still sleep good, digest good, and be better for it.\" But that like 01% change it's going to make doesn't matter to most people. And even now as a retired bodybuilder, I'd be less tricked on doing something like that myself. So Clean Bulk vs. Dirty Bulk why would you clean bulk versus dirty bulk? I would say people with dirty bulk are just people who don't understand the indepth like minutia of how important every little thing is to your body. So I just think it's just kind of the easy way out. I need to get some calories in. I'm going to throw some shitty food down. It's also a very like a band-aid. The short-term solution for a long-term goal that you have. You just do that for a year, 2 years, even 5 years from 20 to 25. Maybe you'll get away with if you're lucky, but it will start to catch up on you. So, I just don't even recommend dirty bulking. Throw in your cheat meals if you really want them and need them. But clean bulking is the way to go. We're not just trying to get jacked. You want to take care of your body. And when you build that healthy relationship with food that you're nourishing your body, you're fueling your body. You're putting good food in your body because you care about your body. It also makes it easier to diet because then you're not craving shitty foods when you're dieting because food isn't just like a obsessive I can have now or can't have it now. It's actually something that you appreciate and you're putting good things in your body. And when I switched that mindset of eating for health rather than just like restricting now or eating as much as I can now and I was like, no, I'm putting good food to take care of my body. When I started prepping, I didn't even crave shitty food anymore. I was like, I want a little more rice and chicken, but like it is what it is. I'm dieting. And it made it much easier for me. Just a little mindset switch. As I said, it's so case dependent and bulking. Like when I was a 21year-old trying to put on as much muscle as possible. I remember putting on like 20 or 30 lbs one offseason, probably more than that. And I\nwas like 270 plus lbs. Midday. I was like 275ish. And I dieted down to 220. And I was like eating shitty food, messing up my digestion. Didn't care cuz I was 21 years old and I was just pushing things. And that variance made it really hard for me. So I stopped doing that. So this is kind of again back to when you should stop bulking. If you're a bodybuilder, you really only need to go like 10% over your weight. So, I started being 20 lbs over my competing weight, which made it much easier for me to come back and down and make that weight and not stress my body out too much. It made my bulking way more efficient. But I had also been doing that for a decade. So, when you're at the beginning of your career, things are different. And this is why I always say, don't just listen to what I say. Kind of just take knowledge in and try things out for yourself and see what works best for you at this point in your journey. Cuz what works for me won't necessarily work for you. When I was young, I could dirty bulk, do all the things. Same with you guys when you're young and get away with these things. When I had to eat six almost 7,000 calories sometimes, I threw in some dirty food cuz at the end of the day, I just couldn't eat another bowl of chicken rice. I was just over it. I'd have a protein shake, peanut butter and jelly, go to bed, and just it is what it is. Now that I'm 30 years old and I'm a little older, my turn is good, digestion is good, everything is clean food, and you got to be a little bit more strict. But luckily, because I had more muscle mass on me, I didn't have to eat as much food. So, I was actually eating way more food when I was younger than I am now because I've already built such a good base. So, there's always something different going on in your journey. Just grab the basics, top of the knowledge that I'm giving you right now. Start with this, track it, pay attention to how your body responds, and then adapt accordingly because it's that's the only thing that's going to make you successful, understanding your body and being able to [Music] adapt. All right, so next question. And we're in my personal supplement shop here. Best supplements for bulking. Best Supplements for Bulking Number one got to be creatine. If you're trying to put on muscle, creatine is the best muscle ever. It's good for your brain. It's good for energy. It's good for repair. It's good for putting on muscle. It's the most studied sports nutrition supplement ever. If you're not taking it, you're falling behind. There's so many of the supplements that help build muscle, but specific to bulky and trying to work hard. Number one thing I would say is digestion. I have a pretty good array of digestive supplements that you use at different times. One specifically is a glucose supplement, a GDA glucose disposal agent, typically chromium, Burberry, and a few other things in there that help. And this just helps your body actually utilize all the carbs that you're taking. I never took insulin as a bodybuilder. Some people dabble in that. And it's such a anabolic hormone because it allows your body to use more food and shuttle it into your muscle. So, there's more natural supplements to take. Like I said, Hani makes one called Evalog that has digestive enzymes and a bunch of GDAS in it. Revive has one called glucose. That's a stronger version of just the GDAS. Super helpful. You just take them with every single meal. Super easy to take. Other than that, like I said, the digestive enzymes as well as betain HCL. This bad boy right here. A lot of people don't have the proper stomach acidity for them to digest food, especially a lot of protein. When you're bulking like a bodybuilder, you're eating a lot of protein. So taking a supplement that helps like aid your gut essentially so it doesn't have to work so hard itself is super beneficial cuz the average person should not and does not need to be eating 5,000 plus calories a day. So you want to give your body as much assistance as possible to make sure like I said you're absorbing those nutrients you're actually using them and you're able to pass that food through you so you don't get bloated. You can't eat your next meal and then you just start falling behind. So digestion is absolutely key creatine and anything that helps you uptake carbs. Other than that, of course, post-workout shake, protein powder. It's like the most basic supplement in the world, but \nit's so helpful. Do you need it?\nAbsolutely not. Can you get away without it? You're damn good if you can, cuz I always need it both through prep or an off season. And I still really believe that a post post-workout shake is extremely important. I like to get my EAS midwork still and then right after my workout or at least soon getting in like 50 75 g of carbs with 50 g of protein. And I take that all in powder form. It's just super easy to get down. I can eat again an hour later. I know people are like, \"The anabolic window doesn't matter or whatnot.\" Maybe it doesn't. It probably doesn't if you're getting all your food in, but if it makes me 5% better or.1% better, I'm going to do it. I'm a professional bodybuilder. I want to take everything I can. And it's not that hard to drink a protein shake after your workout. And to be able to get that protein in, starts your your anabolism immediately. Your body's not breaking down tissue anymore. You're rebuilding it. Your recovery gets in immediately. your cortisol drops because your body's starting to get into rest and digest phase which actually also helps your recovery and the quicker you get in the quicker you can eat a meal after that and then go to bed earlier to get good sleep. So all super important things to help your gains and some benefits of supplements. All right, so gym Training While on a Bulk questions. People are always asking how to train in a cut versus a bulk and all these things. And at the end of the day, it doesn't really matter that much if you're training really hard and progressively overloading on proper periodization. You're following my app and you're doing all the stuff you already know. But at the end of the day, it doesn't matter that much. But if you take a look at what's going on when you're on a bulk, if you have a little bit more fluid in your body, therefore in your joints, you have more energy. You're recovering a little bit faster, a little bit easier, there's more nutrients to uptake. And a lot of people think lift really heavy in this phase and yes you should lift really heavy but the thing you can actually get away with more so is doing more volume more intensify just a higher level of hypertrophy. So training in a bulk with a lot of food even on refeed days or whatever you want to up your volume and intensifiers on those days. So things like double, triple sets, drop sets, rest pauses, all those kind of things are what you want to do in a bulk because your body can actually handle that much stimulus and recover from it and you have enough nutrients in your body to push that much volume for a longer workout. It's kind of a different thinking than you might think when you're eating more. You want to do more weight, but you actually want to just still be heavy as possible, but more volume, more intensifiers, and it'll get more gains to use all that food. Like I Chris's Training Cycle said, there's no like optimal perfect way to do it, but that's the way I would do it. And to give an example of the way that my year used to look like with training is I would take some time off, which I would be in right now post Olympia if I were competing again. Give my body a break to kind of recover, get back into it, and then I would start rebuilding my strength for a little bit as food still low, not too high. And as my food ramped up, I would try and have my strengths already back by then. And then I would start doing a crazy amount of volume with that base of strengths. They'll get a little bit stronger at the beginning of your offseason. Then my food gets really high. Use that strength, keeping the weights the same. But then you start adding rest pauses, drop sets, super sets, all the kind of crazy [beep] of just like killing the muscle, pushing some more sets past failure, training with the training partner, all those things that would stress your nervous system a little bit more, but are easier to recover when you have more food in you. So that's the way I would get do it. And right at the end of my offseason when I'd be like peak volume, peak hypertrophy, just like hammering my body. And then when my calorie would start to drop, I would actually start increasing the weight a little bit because my volume would naturally have to come down because I don't have as much energy. glycogen stores in my muscle. Got to drop the volume a little bit, but I keep the weight as high as possible because a stronger muscle is often bigger muscle. So, if you already have the size to your muscle, maintaining strength will maintain the muscle, especially with low calories. So, sometimes it reverses what you think, but it's what I did in the last like pretty much of my whole career and it really helped me get strong,\nmake gains, and hold those gains throughout my prep. All right, next question. \nShould You Do Cardio While Bulking? \nShould you do cardio on a bulk? Like I said, everything is person specific, but if I had to give an overarching answer, it would be yes. for many reasons. Especially as a bodybuilder, the bigger you get, you want to take care of your heart. Obviously, cardio is a way to have the best heart health. So, keeping up with that is super important. But also, not caring about your health. If your goal is just to eat more, cardio helps you eat more. The amount of calories you're going to burn from doing 20 to 30 minutes of cardio, it's nowhere near what you can eat. You can have a bite of a sandwich and overcome the amount of calories you do in 20 minutes of cardio. So, it's really nothing to be afraid of. A lot of people like, I'm trying to huge. I don't want to do cardio cuz I don't want to sacrifice gains. That's complete [beep] Unless you're running marathons or biking two hours fasted or doing anything, you're not going to be losing any muscle. There's a few tips that you can do. Like if you are doing fast cardio because you love doing in the morning, I would 100% recommend taking an amino before that just so you're not burning through muscle. Your body at least kicks some proteins into the fish. At least get three grams of lucine, two scoops of EAS or something and you're good to go. Also, one of the easiest things to do, and this is the Stan efforting thing he used to always talk about on his diet, is doing a 105 minute walk after every single meal that you eat. You're not going to burn through the food that you ate. I promise you, you're not even going to be close to it. But what it is going to do, get your digestion going, lower your blood sugar, help your insulin a little bit, allow your body to actually utilize those nutrients that you put in your body, and then eat quicker in your next meal. Like sometimes you eat a lot and you just want to lie there and you feel like crap, like after Thanksgiving, you just want to pass out. But if you actually go for a walk, your body will start moving that food through you quicker and then you can eat again quicker. It's going to help your insulin levels, which will help your body uptake the food better. So there's a lot of benefits that come into it. So cardio good for your heart. It's actually going to help you eat more and it just helps move the food through you. So I 100% recommend cardio on a bulk. I wasn't always the best at keeping up with this if I'm being completely honest. But I did noticed to a te in the years where I didn't do cardio, but I ate as much as I could. My appetite wasn't as good and I put on fat quicker. Not muscle, but fat. When I was doing a good amount of cardio, I could eat more. I felt better. My body was utilizing it for muscle better than it was at adding fat. So, I just noticed a different body composition when my body was doing when I was choosing to do cardio in my season. So, in the end, when I was doing it all the time, I felt way better. And I absolutely recommend it to everyone. Whether you're skinny, fat, whatever. If you're skinny as [beep] do less cardio. If you're fat, do more. Don't overthink it, but focus on your [Music] heart. All right. So, another question I \nHow Fast Should You Gain Weight? \nalways get asked is around how fast should you gain weight? How do you know \nif you're gaining too fast or too slow? \nAnd again, everything is so person dependent. It's so hard for me to even answer these, but I'm trying to give you guys something to go off of. So, take what I say and apply it to yourself in real life and adapt it. But I would say in the range of 2 to 2 lb a week is like good. It's great for gaining muscle. Again, that could be from a beginner to someone who's advanced. So, when I was young and I was like 18 years old training, I could probably put 2 lbs of muscle on if I really bulked and\ntrained hard and went efficient. And it life, it was incredible. It was amazing. And now over the last 4 years, I've maybe put on 4 lbs of muscle doing what I've been doing. And I've been struggling to do that. And that's me guessing cuz I'm always a little bit leaner and not as lean. So it's like my stage weight is variable. But it's really hard. So it really comes down to a lot of different things. But I think what's super important is having a high standard of which you hold yourself to. So your norm of how you look, you should be proud of how you look. You're working out to feel good, to look good, to be good. So you want to be happy with how you look. So if you start from a leaner spot and you bulk and you don't want to change too much from that, you're not going to be too fat obviously versus if you start from a fatter spot, you get a little more fat, you're more fat than that. So having that norm, that high standard to which you hold yourself to that you're proud of how you look is super important when it comes to these things. It's hard to manage tracking body fat with clips or BMIs or all these things. So, if you're taking constant check-in pictures of yourself, put your weight beside it, the amount of food you're eating with that, and you're following along those things, and you're seeing how your body's adapting, you're much better off than just like guessing what's going on. And obviously, gaining weight, there's so many variables that could be when you first start bulking. You know, your glycogen stores are filling up. You're holding on to more water. Carbs make you hold on more water. Creatine sometimes can, but then it typically levels out. So, don't stress about that. I don't want to say that. But there's so many different things that can make you hold on to weight that aren't just fat or muscle. Water, fat, or muscle are the main top three that it's going to be. So, you really need to be careful of what the difference is. If you diet, if you bulk for a year and you put on 20 lbs and then you diet down and you lose 19. For the average person, that's not a very good bulk. If you're like an elite bodybuilder, then you're doing all right. For the average person, you probably didn't need to put that 20 lbs on to gain one lb of muscle. So, try and like just even that ratio up. Again, I hate giving numbers, but if you're putting on 10% in a year, you're doing pretty good for yourself, depending on the level at which you're at. Just keep watching yourself. Don't let yourself get too fat. Be happy with how you look. Monitor your breathing, your heart rate, all these different things are super important. How you feel, how you look, end up going to the final result. So, \nHow Long Should I Bulk For? \nit's all important. All right. Next \nthing is, how long should I build core? \nMinimum time to put on muscle. If you put on muscle, you put on muscle. But there is a the longer period of time you're holding it, the less likely you are to lose it when you cut really hard. That's something to take into account. If you bulk for 2 months and then you cut really hard, you're probably going to lose a good amount of that muscle versus if you're someone who's been holding on to that muscle for a year, 2 years, 3 years, or 6 months versus a 2-month bulk, you're more likely to hold on to it. So, just take that into consideration. I personally liked a longer bulk because I didn't feel like I had to force it as hard and have to put a bunch of food in really fast. I could slowly taper up 250, 300, 400 calories at a time as my body would plateau. I would just add a little bit more food, add a little bit more food, and my body wouldn't put on fat as quick. The slower the change you make, the more likely you are to put on good weight rather than just fat. So, understand that. Take your time. The longer you hold it, the longer your body's going to maintain it. Also, \nGoal Setting\nagain, super important to be specific on what your goals are and definitely not goal hop around. If you're like, \"Oh, I want to bulk.\" And you bulk a little bit and your abs are a little less shredded. I want to cut. and you start cutting a bit and like I want to be bigger and you start flip-flopping back and forth, you're going to make zero progress and there's no point doing that. So start something and commit to it and understand what your goals are. If your goals are to put on muscle, but you hate when you lose your abs and do a really slow, long bulk, very slow increase of calories. Make sure your abs are staying there. Stick to training your abs. Stick to doing your cardio, eating good food, no inflammation, you won't hold on as much water, you won't look as chubby, won't feel better. All these different things. If all you want to do is put on as much muscle as fast as possible, you don't give a [beep] That's the type of person who pushes it a little bit faster or a little bit longer. So, you kind of got to figure out what your goals are and tailor your work towards your goal. All right, last question and another big one, crucial one. I've been here. What \nWhat if I Can't Increase my Appetite? \nif I can't eat enough and how to increase my appetite? Can't is a very strong word. Whenever I meet someone and they come up to me often at expos, they're like 170 lbs. Like, I can't put on muscle. I can't eat enough. I'm like, you're lying. eat more, train harder, and just do it. There's it's always a possibility. If you really can't put food down and you're skinny skinny, there's probably a reason why your cortisol is too high. Your recovery isn't good enough. You need to sleep better. You need to slow down. You need to eat better foods. You need to check your gut. There's there's a reason why people aren't just that word hardgain gainer. People are harder than gaining than others, but there's no hard gainer who can't eat and gain weight. It's complete [beep] You just have to do it and it takes a long period of time. So the biggest thing is I think honestly is like I mentioned the cortisol sleep recovery. If all that stuff is on point, your body can take in food. There's people you hear about stress eating and people who there's no term for it, but people when they get stressed who just they forget to eat all day. A week go by and they eat one meal a day maybe just because they're so stressed out all the time. When your body's in a fight orflight state, cortisol is running through your body. It's not ready to rest and digest. It's why people say rest and digest. You're in a fight fight or flight cortisol. your body's not ready to digest food. It's not ready to take in food. So, it's super important to eat in a calm state to like be in a relaxed state as often as possible to get your sleep in. Sleep and rest and low cortisol is like the secret to bodybuilding. Me, my ability to like lower my stress at times when I was in prep literally won me Olympias. It's so crucial and it comes in so importantly into bulking as well. So, yeah, that would I would say that's the biggest thing, especially post-workout when you're training, you're at a high level of stress, which is important. you're putting your body through a stimulus and the quicker you can switch your body from fight and flight into rest and digest the better you're doing. So after a workout, if you can like meditate, chill, get your protein in, listen some vibing music on the way home. Don't just get on your phone, go back to work, stress yourself out with some stuff, just like calm your nervous system, you'll be recovering better and you'll be able to eat and absorb more nutrients after that workout. Super important. On top of that, just a little tip trick that everyone knows to do, smoothies. \nPRO TIP \nYou're eating your meals throughout the day. Understand your meals that you can get. Nutrient timing is so important. Pairing that with smoothies, it's the secret. If you figure out your body's nutrient timing of when it can absorb certain foods, certain meals in the best way, you're going to crush it. Me, I like having low carbs in the morning cuz then my entire appetite for the rest of the\nday is bigger. A lot of times I used to think, oh, I need a 1500 calorie breakfast to get these calories in so I don't need as much later in the day. But then I can't eat my meals later in the day and I screw myself. But if you have a high highfat low carb breakfast, your insulin levels are actually more consistent throughout the day rather than spiking and dropping and peaks and valleys throughout the day. So, it's a lot healthier for your body and easier to eat your meals later on the day. So, highfat, whole food, high protein breakfast. Start getting your carbs in around your workout. Bulk of your carbs would be pre and post-workout. I could handle them pre and didn't make me tired, so I was completely fine. And some points in the day, have a massive smoothie. I liked having mine later in the day if it didn't fill my stomach up too much before sleeping. You throw in some intraworkout carbs, some protein powder, some whole eggs for some real nutrients, some oats if you want, some peanut butter, almond butter, whatever you want to throw in there. Whatever your body digests, great. Blend it all up. Drink it before bed. You can get in easily 1,200 calories in a shake. And you don't need to get mass and stuff like that cuz it'll just [beep] your stomach up. Unless you can handle it, good for you. But I never could. So, digest or smooth jeez, blend, load your [beep] up, drink a smoothie, digest it good, go to sleep, and get huge. So, another big thing on that, increase your appetite, low cortisol, nutrient timing, big smoothies, take three. All right, so that's the bulk of these questions. I'm sure I rambled on a heavy amount. If you guys have any more question, drop them in the comment section below. I will add them to the next Q&A; that we do. But yeah, these are the biggest tips and tricks I can say that I've done. I've gone through many different phases of my career bulking really hard and not bulking really hard and again I listened to so much knowledge over my career. I took in so much stuff and I tried so many things. The only thing that stuck were what worked for me. You have to like flow with things. You have to like treat bodybuilding like the art it is and understand that there's so many nuances to it that it's dependent on each specific person and only you can figure out that out for yourself because only you know yourself. So trial and error, pay attention, track things. What is it measured? isn't managed. Lock it all in and get [beep] huge. So that's it. Thank you guys for watching."

Chris Bumstead \nVerbatim transcript (provided by user) \nthis is going out the day after the Olympia what do you hope happened \nyesterday well I certainly hope I won definitely easiest answer to give this \nyear is just very important to me to really want to bring my best package you know it sounds cheesy to say but I've \nbeen working hard going through a lot of adversities and challenges over the years and every Year's had something \nkind of like get in my way and felt like it would holding me back this year's had a few earlier on in the year but at this \npoint point I'm feeling pretty good feeling pretty set so just want to be able to stride into this one I want to be able to enjoy it I want to be able to \nyou know get off stage kiss my wife hold my baby know that I became the best in \nthe world and maintained a beautiful relationship through it how important is it to share the success with somebody \nelse as opposed to just doing it for yourself it's hard to say how important \nit is because I haven't had the success without her but I can't imagine it in any other way I think you know in the meaning we find in life it's beautiful to do hard things and to accomplish things but if you were to do it alone it's just not the same as being \nable to share with someone I think there's a level of you know codependence and regulation that can be healthy and \ncan help you push through be more present not have to shut off and numb so much you know I think a lot of people \nwho going through hard things trying to accomplish really big levels of success numb a lot to get there and I think being able to have a partner in which you can regulate yourself with and share and communicate and lean on prevents you \nfrom having to numb brings you closer together which is its own experience as well as the experience of whatever you're working toward so it's like double the amount of joy that you get to feel growing in two ways at once exactly yeah and who doesn't want a big hug after you accomplish something you know yeah that's cool what will you be talking about in your speech hopefully in my speech hopefully it's a good \nquestion I would say just talking about this year I've been thinking a lot about \nthe sacrifices that come with success you know like nothing comes for free and \nI've reflected a lot over the years of how much of my mental peace I've had to sacrifice to accomplish what I've accomplished and it's just been a lot of like waking up at 5:00 a.m. going through the day wake up weigh myself weigh my food do my check-ins in the mirror like go to the gym work out how WR everything is like am I good enough \nam I being enough am I doing enough to win the Olympia right now it's all just compared to being Mr Olympia to that \nlevel of success and you know people talk about what you sacrifice to be great at things and they normally like you don't get to go hang out with your \nfriends you don't get to go party go go do these things but I think for me the biggest sacrifice has just been the my me my mental Peace So the goal this year has been trying to find that maintain it have the mental peace while also \nthriving at a high level and seeing how I can do that as as efficiently as possible and you know I'd like to be able to say I did so successfully talk to me about the the tension of being as \nhigh of a performer the best in the world of what you do whilst also so not having that neurotic drive that sort of ambient anxiety that you can never switch off because it seems like that \nanxiety is precisely what creates the perfectionism approach that allows you\nPage 1 \nDiscipline & Mindset Interview ? Chris Bumstead (Transcript) 2025-10-27 \nto cover all of those bases is it possible to have one without the other I'm not sure I still have a level of neuroticism in me even though I've been succeeding for like five six years now and it's definitely gotten better you know I I don't focus on perfection I focus on just being doing the best I can but even within that I have that voice \nin my head that will look at myself every now and then be like it's not that I'm a shitty person but if I'm trying to be Mr lumpy like you're not doing enough and it creates a like a impeding anxiety upon myself like I'm not doing enough and that's not like an overwhelming thing all the time it's it's a drive for me to keep being better and keep pushing more and more but it's a lot so I think being able to manage that is one of the most challenging things of maintaining success for an extended period of time you know there's two different mindsets when you win something there's oh I won I did it I'm \ndone and then there's oh like I better I got to do better than this one \nnow I have to maintain this not only maintain this but this is the bare minimum of what's expected of me and I got to do better now so there's the \nbalance of all that and I think over the last couple years I've been able to really be able to fix my perspective on just being grateful for the privilege of it you know there's been times where I thought I was going to stop competing \nbecause the pressure felt so high and then when I started to step away from it I was like I would really miss this pressure like there something I love about it there something I love about being put back against the corner like knowing that there's a lot of work I have to do feeling like I can't accomplish my goal and you're going to have to do it there's something so like \nsimple and beautiful in the meaning of just doing something that difficult under that level of pressure that you're choosing to do you know people say you \nfind meaning in suffering and I think if you put yourself into like a meaningless suffering it's kind of just it's dumb there's no point you're just hurting yourself for no reason but if you can find your meaning in Just Doing Hard that are as close as possible to \nsuffering that you're still benefiting from and you still enjoy I think it's beautiful that's one of the vicious double-edged swords of having success if you have that kind of mentality which I know all all too well that anytime you \nreach a new high or achieve some new kind of bar MH hooray we did it \nimmediately the next thought after that is oh I now need to do it again but better that's now the next minute mhm yeah and I've I've had conversations with many people about the possibility of not having that and just being able \nto enjoy and relieve the pressure on yourself and you know there's all these studies that come out talk about motivation and drive saying that you can get more from coming from like a secure place rather than beating yourself up \nand it's like it depends on what your version of success is like can these people correct live a life to be more happy and fulfilled yes but will they be Michael Jordan have six championships dude I probably not you know I love this \ntopic I love it so much and uh I think the bottom line is that if you're \ntalking about beating everybody else on the planet to a thing what you're actually talking about is what are you prepared to sacrifice psychologically physically existentially relationally \nsocially in terms of your self-esteem your confident everything right all of that because if you're if there's even a part of you that's thinking well I'm going to do this I'm going to balance it because I want to feel satisfied I want feel comfortable with myself and so on \nand so forth that's fine for as long as it contributes to your performance within the domain that you're competing in but as soon as you sacrifice any \noutput in that that's just an opening for somebody else that's the competitor that's going to come in and get it because I use this example of Eddie Hall World's Strongest Man uh 2017 or 18 I \nthink and he's there you know he's worked hard toward this final goal he wins it once and he's crying and he's\nPage 2 \nDiscipline & Mindset Interview ?

Filler words, repetitions, and asides were trimmed for readability while preserving the original meaning and voice.\nIntro \nwhat is up YouTube going to be doing a Q&A; today I suck at doing these on my Instagram story and I always feel like I have more that I want to say and I don't like answering those stupid short answer questions so I'm going to be getting into some questions here probably rambling a bunch maybe not making sense but hopefully this kind of gives you guys an Insight on how I process things my mentality and a bunch of [ __ ] that you guys have been asking that I'm open to answer what is the \nOrigin story of 'Champion Mentality' ? how it developed Origin Story \nchampion mentality and how did it \ndevelop so honestly the or origin story \nis pretty boring it was literally just \ntrying to think of like something to put \non a T-shirt and I've always been a huge \nlike believer that me your mentality \nyour mental state your mental toughness \neverything is a huge driver of success \nand what separates like true like long \nlasting champions from people who just \nwin once or twice and it developed a lot \nmore over the years as I started to \nreally understand just how important \nyour mind is in competitive Sports \nsuccess career absolutely anything and \nunderstanding that you are Your Own \nWorst Enemy all the time you are \nliterally competing against yourself all \nthe time and that the champion mentality \nisn't so much about being a champion and \nwinning trophies but it's about having \nno quit like I said in my Olympia speech\nit's about giving your all giving your \nbest setting the standard for yourself \nso that you are putting in your best \nwork to get your own best result whether \nyou win or lose you're competing with a \nchampion mentality to be the best \nversion of yourself it's kind of what \nit's developed into and I mean more \nevery year I try and learn more about my \nmental state and that's my Champion \nmentality hardest part of Olympia \nHardest part of Olympia prep (mental health) prep I mean honestly there's a lot of \nhard Parts but if I'm going to be one \nthing that just jumps in my head so I'll \npick that is probably the battle \ninternal battle I have in my mind about \nmy health partly because of what I stuff \nI've gone through in the past but also \nif you're a bodybuilder and you cana at \nhigh level and you have absolutely zero \nconcern for your health you're probably \nlying and denying how you feel or you're \njust stupid cuz obviously it's you're \nputting a lot of stress on your body \nyou're doing a lot of so it \ndefinitely takes a toll on me and \nsometimes I get in these moments and I'm \nlike like is something happening\nthere something wrong like why am I \ndoing this just to step on stage and \ncompete like is it worth it and I get in \nthese head battles like that and that's \nwhen I know I need to be doing my health checks blood work everything making sure I'm healthy I'm working with a new \ndoctor now and making sure everything's on point so I can like instead of \nthinking I'm feeling good I know I'm \ndoing everything I can to feel good and also just learning to not live in fear \nbecause anything can happen at any time in your life and if you choose to do \nsomething then do it don't do it and \nthen like stress about doing it or you \nmight as well not be doing it at all cuz \nI don't want to live my life like that \nwhat would you say is the best way to \nSupersets vs one body part at a time make good Gams super sets or focusing on one body part at a time I mean if you're talking about super setting two \ndifferent body parts I would say \ndefinitely focusing on one body part at a time I'm a huge believer in like the \ngood old bro split type workouts where you just destroy one body part train a \nfull intensity on that day other every\nother style of workout Works was well I \njust like that style and I think you \nshould be putting all your focus and \nenergy into like each set that you're \ndoing not worrying about oh I just did a \nset of chest I'm a super set with back \nlike to me that's insane you haven't \nrested enough to give all out for both \nsets but if you're talking about super \nsets as in the same body part in a \ndifferent range of motion like if you're \ndoing a bicep curl and you go from a \nstretch position arm kind of at your \nback behind you into like a preacher \ngirl in front of you where you're a \nlittle stronger then that has its \nbenefit but the way you worded it saying \none body part a time I would say yes one \nbody part at a time how's the \nBalancing business ownership and Mr. Olympia Balance \nbeing a business partner SL owner and Mr \nOlympia honestly this is something I \nhave been struggling with in the last \nlittle bit and I think it's just partly \nbecause it was new and know my whole \nlife I've only had like not my whole \nlife my whole competing career I've had \nabsolutely one focus and all I really\ncared about and that was competing and winning and that's still my top priority right now it's still my number one goal but I have other things that bring me a lot of fulfillment and happiness as well such as business and raw and tum Fitness and everything else I'm trying to build right now and other things that are coming soon and I think it struggled cuz it was something new and I was kind of bouncing around not sure whated to do and not sure where I should put my priorities and while bodybuilding \nselfish the business I have a lot of partners with I felt like I almost owed them a little bit of like to do more work and be more involved do more like that and over time now I've been like if I really want to help them right now the best thing I can do for \nbusinesses and my own career myself are to be the best bodybuilder I can so I had to sit down and really figure out what my priority was and I had sit there I like would you rather business or Mr Olympia and without a doubt Mr Olympia so with that I've had to rearrange like my thought structure throughout the day so if it's like going to be a long day\nlots of work or something like I got to \nleave early not going to the office \ntoday if it's a shitty leg day or \nwhatever and make sure that I have full \nenergy for my workout and I \nalso they're like it's it's my choice \nreally I don't have to be going in there \nand doing as much as possible but I \nenjoy being a part of the business as \nmuch as I can be so just finding that \nbalance and learning as I go but it's a \nnew process and when I get into prep and \nit really gets serious and I'm getting \ntired I'm just going to put all my focus \nin the bodybuilding take a step back and \nluckily I have a amazing team and \npartners that I trust to do absolutely \neverything as perfectly as can be done \nwhat are your \nFocus points for this year's Olympia (mental & physical) Focus Points \nyear's Olympia mentally and \nphysically uh mentally I would say one \nof the biggest things always every year \nI want to be present as possible \nthroughout my prep not just the end I've \ngotten really good at being present in \nthe peak week and on stage and just \nreally enjoying every single moment and\nI want to be a little better at that and prep when I'm going through some stress and like that and like kind of \nenjoy the process of what my body's going through cuz I'm going to look back at these days and be like that was some crazy that was awesome so I want to be able actually enjoy that and I also want to be able to not live in fear and stress like I talked about in my health I want to learn to just take a step away from that understand that I am in control of my health doing absolutely everything I can and there's a lot of new stuff with this doctor I'm working with now to help Excel my health even more and keep it even better and last year with the healthiest I've ever been so I'm like you just did it like just \nlive in that positivity if something \nhappens you'll deal with it but you're not going to expect it to \nhappen and then physically um number one thing that comes to my mind is I want to Peak better this year I think in the last 48 hours 24 hours of the Olympia I kind of like lost my look a little bit I ran a little too flat I was afraid to \nhave any sodium cuz I happen in years in\nthe past and I think it kind of took a \naway from my look a little bit and I \nthink I'm going to need that extra Edge \nto win another Olympia cuz the \ncompetition's getting really tough and I \nmean also obviously I want to keep \nbringing up specific body parts like my \nback and my arms and probably be \nprobably practice my posing a little \nmore this year cuz I never seem to do \nthat what if you want to be the youngest \nIs it wrong to hop on gear at a young age? ifbb pro is it wrong to hop on gear at a \nyoung age absolutely yes because I'm \ntelling you right now when I was young I \nthought it would be super cool to be the \nyoungest pro the youngest Mr lumpia the \nyoungest whatever no one gives a flying \nI was pro at \n21 on the Olympia stage at 22 I believe \nand no one knows that no one cares no \none remembers a year a week after it \nhappened people were like wow look how \nyoung he is and then no one cares do you \nwant to be the best of something for for \nsomeone who's young or do you want to be the best period personally I want to be \nthe best period not just the best young \nperson to do something so\nage don't hop on gear learn the basics \nget strong enjoy the gym and take it all \nslow why do people consider Sumo \ndeadlift cheating and do you well they \nconsider it cheating because it is \ncheating scenario you can compete and \nIf you could win any Olympic medal, which sport and why? win an Olympic medal what sport would \nyou Cho shoes and \nwhy I think Winter Olympics I would do \nsnowboard halfpipe I've always love \nsnowboarding and I Love Shawn White um \nand Summer Olympics 100 meter sprint all \nthe way just to say that you're the \nfastest person in the world would just \nbe awesome what would you say is the \nDriving factor between success and failure \ndriving factor between success and \nfailure don't be generic I feel like I \ncan't not be generic because the reason \nthings are generic is because it was a \ntruth but there's not a lot of crazy \nthings I don't know if about success and \nfailure cuz a lot of people can be lucky \nand successful but I think a huge thing \nsome people lack others not need more of \nit but is you need to believe in \nyourself like absolutely and fully know\nthat you believe in yourself and need to believe in yourself from things from doing things such as or having an understanding that if you are doing everything at the best of your ability that's in your control then you know you will be successful from that and then that kind of creates a release of anxiety of the stuff that's out of your control and you just focus on what what is in your control I think all really successful people have a mindset that can detach from whatever they their control whatever might happen or come into your life and only focus on what they can do and doing that at the best of their \nability hopefully that's not too generic \nFavorite anime \nWhat is your favorite anime \nday are there any new flavors coming for raw products we're coming up with two products coming in lemon lime we got a chocolate peanut butter limited edition protein coming we actually we have a lot we have a a board up of like new drops every single month but the next one I believe is lemon lime and we'll be announcing all the flavors as they come\nbut we got a lot a lot in store what \nWhy grow the mullet? \nmade you grow the mullet so honestly the what made me grow the mullet started with the mustache and I shaved my facial hair into a mustache literally as a joke thinking it would be ugly and it would be stupid and like trying to like do something kind of funny and I ended up kind of looking good and catching on people been like wow that's classic like that coool so I rocked it and it just became my thing now I won't compete without it and then the hair was the same thing I'm like all right the \nmustache mustache ended up being cool what can I do that's actually going to be ugly and stupid and I was like it cut your hair into a mullet and just like Let It Grow and when I was young I had I had hair that flipped out and I always wore hats I would tuck behind my ears and flip it out but I hated having long hair on the side of my head cuz I don't have like nice hair here it would get like frizzy so having a mullet I really need a haircut right now but having a mullet got rid of that and it let me keep the flow in the back and it\nactually ended up looking cool so I kept it as well been rocking it what are some \nHow do you manage stress? things you do to manage stress um good question uh in prep well still I see a therapist less frequently now but I have I do see a therapist I think that can be so beneficial to anyone even if you don't think you're like you need it it can help you just be more successful and build a stronger mindset it gives you someone to talk to that an unbiased opinion that you can just share anything with like any thoughts that you might not feel comfortable sharing with even close ones cuz they might be about them or whatever or fears you want to express it just helps to get them out so that communicating as well whether a therapist or with a partner when I talk to things Courtney that I'm trustful about you just I just feel better she's not doing anything but if I can just express it I feel better and I'm also naturally an introvert at heart I don't always I like being around people like I love people but I need some sometimes where I'm just like alone like right now Courtney been gone for like 3 days she's\nin Arizona and I've had this time like alone and I feel like a little bit reset like my batteries are recharged and I kind of helps me when I'm stressed out there's usually Lots going on I need to just detach be alone and just like calm my mind and understand that like oh the you're stressing about usually \nisn't that important and if it is then you should be doing something about it \nFavorite sneaker of all time favorite sneaker of all time probably Jordan one Low's I love the highs but they're just like not as easy to wear all the time the Jord one low is just a \nFavorite Kanye album \ngoat what is your favorite Connie album uh My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy for sure what advice would you \nAdvice for young lifters \ngive to Young lifters people always asked this and I finally thought of a decent question when somebody asked me at the gym the other day in person and is to focus on the basics focus on the absolute most basic principles of \nlifting and you will be very successful if you focus on form execution mind\nmuscle connection \ncontraction everything like that just at the best of its ability you will be a lot stronger for it if you're trying to think of like new fancy exercise like chest pressing to the side and crazy LP pullovers with wrist attachments and cables and all these setups you're just sinking on the wrong spots if you but if you focus on intensity and execution form mind musle connection that's really all you need you can stick with the most basic exercise do the same forever but if you're training harder and more effectively then you'll benefit from it a cool side note a cool thing that I've heard a bunch of times but the number one thing Michael Jordan started with in practice was chess pass which you would say think it's the most basic thing you would do but it's just sticking to the basics and nailing those things getting those perfect because at the end of the day the flashy cool different crazy things aren't really what you apply every single day but something like a chess pass how many times in a game do they shoot a chess pass how many times do you just need to bench press cable\nfly squat simple things that you can \njust do perfectly and effectively at \nHow do you stay motivated at this stage? this stage in your career how how do you \nstay motivated this is definitely \nsomething that has come in to been a \nlittle bit more difficult in recent \nyears I kind of like feel like I've \naccomplished a lot of what my wanted to \naccomplish and it's almost like creating \nnew goals in my head that I need to \nchase after new difficult tasks that I \nneed to do and it's partly it's \nnitpicking how I looked in years past \nand understanding that I still haven't \nlooked exactly how I want to look and I \nwant to get on stage looking like almost \nperfect at least once before I retire so \nthat kind of edges me to do in a little \nbit better that I wasn't doing properly \nlast year like I was talking about I \nwant to Peak better also just sitting \ndown and like I said picking new goals \nthat it's going to be I wanted to win \nthe Olympia I wanted to Olympia twice I \nwanted to have the most classic Olympia \ntitles I wanted to win was a perfect \nscore I had these like goals and I've \naccomplish all of them now and now it's\njust like what do you want next and I really would love to be like remembered as to the end of time is like one of the goats of classic physique and I want to really like leave my legacy on classic Physique in the \nso my goal is to really accomplish that and that's kind of keeping me motivated right now so I'm trying to put my focus on fine-tuning things chasing stuff I tell myself in my head that people I'm competing as are getting better and better and that they're coming up after me and that I need to push myself more and more and just trying to remember why I started all this cuz I just love \ncompeting I love bodybuilding and I want to keep improving being the best version of myself vert height in high school did \nVertical jump in high school a football combine and I did did a 41.5 in vertical jump and I remember people who shot their pants when I did \nthat and they're like who is this kid and sadly I wasn't that good at football but I could jump damn High favorite \nFavorite cheat meal \ncheat meal is\nprobably uh Thanksgiving \ndinner I think yeah it's the same in \nCanada and us obviously I just had it but like turkey mashed potato stuffing gravy all that kind of stuff I'd love \nthat except I only like getting it once a year so \nDoes creatine really help? Does creatine really help \nI believe in terms of muscle building supplements outside of protein obviously it is probably the most studied \nsupplement that has proven to actually help so yes I believe it does how are \nHow are you so relaxed and chill? you so relaxed and chill a great \nquestion I'm not really sure I think \nsubconsciously I just learned that like kind of ratting the midline not being like two one way or the other kind of leads you to a more stable happy feeling life and I just naturally did I'm also \nvery lucky and grateful to have been raised in a very like loving and \nsupportive family \nand that has given me a lot of \nself-confidence and happiness in my life that not a lot of stress honestly the\nthis past few years of my life have been the most stress I've ever had in my life I'm still relaxed and chill but I I \nstill feel stress inside me and anxiety about certain things but I also really like really focus a lot on mindset and I talk about that a lot probably not enough but like I love reading about like stoic philosophy different mindsets books from like female therapists like bne brown that normally you would think think of body build listen to you different various subjects all talking about mindset and how you can kind of like get through difficult times and understanding to like take your emotions feel them understand them and try not to react to them and think through logic and like I don't know I'm trying to like put a bunch of thoughts into one thing right now but kind of just focusing on my mindset trying to look at things as they are not as I my emotions believe that they are and living like that my my therapist say one the or one of her big keys that she focus on is acceptance of just everything accept everything as it is don't make it worse than it is don't put your emotions into it don't put\nexaggerations onto it just be accepting be like don't be like oh I don't want to be a anxious person I don't want to be have a list I don't want to be nervous to talk to girls don't like think that you don't want anything cuz you're kind of shaming yourself and you're keeping it within you but said accept how you are how you feel about things be like I am this I still love myself for being this but I can grow I can be better I can change into this or look at the positive things of something that you might always see as negative and just find the best things learn to accept it and once you've accepted and you love yourself for all that you are then you can start to grow through things and in my opinion having that understanding in your mind it really makes you kind of relax and chill and it's usually when you're in denial of things of who you are or how you feel that you kind of build more stress anxiety and kind of can react more out of emotion as opposed to logic of the truth that's around \nyou I don't know if that really made sense but with that ramble I think I'm\ngoing to wrap this up it's getting late and I got to eat again so yeah if you guys like this type of video let me know I think it's kind of interesting trying to put my mindset into the questions you give you a little more in depth than I would on like an Instagram quick answer with a few words so if you got this far thank you guys for watching appreciate it and yeah maybe we'll do one of these again if you liked it but until then catch you in the next video"

    "text": "Whiteboard: Commitment, Structure, Community, Tracking (Transcript) \nRecorded transcript ? Formatted on 2025-11-03 (Asia/Seoul) \nWhat is up, YouTube? Busted out the whiteboard today. I feel like one of the last videos I was talking about lack of passion and drive. And in feeling that, I realized I need to make a change. And it was kind of coinciding with the transformation challenge I was launching. And I'm not going to make this about you have to sign up for my transformation challenge cuz it's already too late for that. You [ __ ] You're lost. You're never going to get any progress because you didn't sign up for it. Unless you did, then lucky you. But the idea of signing up for something or committing to something, creating a plan, a structure, a deadline, community, all these different things are something that help hold you accountable to actually hit your goals so much more than people understand. I think it's scary to commit to something because then you're leading yourself to failure and self-d disappointment. And if you have like limiting self-beliefs of not being able to do something, you're like feeling you're going to reinforce them. But the actual idea of committing to something, putting it out there makes you more likely like likely to succeed. And I was just thinking about that concept of how much it affected me after not having the Olympia as my thing I was committed to and then having this transformation challenge where we have these weekly calls that we're getting into. I have a YouTube channel I'm uploading all the time. I'm going to be doing a physique update at the end of this which is [ __ ] scary for me cuz I haven't looked at myself pose in a while. But all these little things that are like, okay, well if I'm doing it, I'm saying I'm doing it. I'm talking to people every week on the standard plus goals and I'm going to have 8 weeks from now another physique update. I'm holding myself accountable and that drives me to be better. And in doing so, I build the momentum and the excitement and the passion, the love to continue to do so. So anyways, the points that I wrote down, commitment equals buyin. Exactly what I was just saying, being able to say something publicly, to actually commit to something, to write it down, to agree to something, to decide on an end date. To do that, it creates buyin in your mind that you're actually doing something, and then you can commit to actually putting in the work. In an old video I did when I was talking about like changing your life, it was the idea that you create your identity and being leads to doing leads to having. So when you create an identity around someone first of all who commits to something that person who commits then commits to the actions that it takes to achieve the goal they've committed to and then you start doing the actions and then you get the thing that you want. So kind of first identity shift being commitment doing the thing starting it and then from there you're like okay [ __ ] I need a plan and a systems to start doing that you start to get specific move forward and then you're actually going to hit some goals. Second thing structure removes guesswork. So once you commit to something, creating structure in something is so important. When I was competing in Olympias, it was like, okay, I'm eating five meals a day to start. By the time I'm eight weeks out, I need to be at six meals a day. So if I can nail this now, then it's good. I So I started building structure. Every day I'm eating at the same time, the same thing moving forward. Every week I have a check-in. Every couple days, I'm calling Hanie. I'm training at the same time in the gym all the time. I created this structure around my life which allowed me not to have to think about things and I just knew it would work. So if you go dayto-day without having proper structure or\nsystem, you're just going to end up falling off and not know where you're ending up. So having the proper specific plans of what you need to do is so important to help yourself moving forward. Next thing is comm community equals accountability. I see this so big right now in our office right now. I'm the last bodybuilder up there. Everyone's evolved into a runner and because they're all running and doing the same thing and they have a community where they're like talking about their miles, talking about the new shoes they got, the new treadmill, XY and Z, all these different things, they're all like pushing each other to get better cuz they know when they come in on Monday, they're going to be like, \"How many miles do you run this weekend?\" They don't want to be that [ __ ] that didn't run any miles. Tell me community is so big. When I was training for Prague and I was training with Brett and Martin in the gym and I was exhausted and these [ __ ] tanks are in there pushing every day, I'm like, I got to show these guys that classic with you guy can push harder than a bodybuilder. And that held me accountable. Can't always do that, which kind of sucks, but having friends, people online, online community, this is something really big. That's why when we built the standard challenge, every Wednesday there's a weekly call. Justin's on all of them giving sick advice. I'm on most of them. And we also have an actual community like a a forum on the circle app that's private. all these people who are on the same challenge doing the same thing are in this so they can talk to each other and hold each other accountable and that's so important because I feel like community is I could dive way deeper into that but we just [ __ ] suck at community. I was listening to a book on anxiety and it was talking about how many friends do you have that would call you to help them move out of their house if they had to move from house to house. Would they call you to move or would they call a stranger and pay them and they probably couldn't afford to do it? And I was like [ __ ] probably none of my friends would cuz my community has shrunk. like that sucks, you know? I want to expand that. I want to be there for people and I want us to have like-minded goals helping us progress and get better. So, lost the community. That was kind of random, but that thought was like it all ties in. Tracking reinforces discipline. I think Justin always says, what isn't measured isn't managed. And this is so important. I think if I could give one piece of advice for people who are trying to diet, it's just track your food. Don't even think about what you're doing than tracking your food. And just having that conscious awareness of what you're putting in your body consistently allows you to progress so much better. And beyond that, tracking stuff like physique updates. I'm gonna look at my physique right now like I still look good. Again, I'm still jacked, but like compared to what I was or where I want to be, I'm not there. Having consistent weekly check-ins where I'm doing that consistently tracking my food, consistently tracking thing, it's the biggest thing to reinforce discipline rather than just saying, \"I know how to eat healthy. I'll just do it.\" Like, no, you're not. [ __ ] off. You know, even I can't do that [ __ ] I tell myself I'm going to do it and then I don't unless my meal plan's written down. I'm tracking my macros. I know what's going in my body. keeping up with my physique, my weight. Logging your weights has been one of the biggest changes I made in the last couple years for driving progress because on those days where you come in and you feel like [ __ ] like, well, last week I did 110 for six, I better do it again at least this week if I feel worse. Pushes you to be better. Reinforces discipline. Second last point, short-term focus equals long-term habit. So, being able to create something with a short-term goal is so important. Like, if I meet someone and they're 17 years old, 120 lbs, and they're like, \"My goal is to win the Olympia.\" I'm like, \"What else?\" I'm like, \"No, I'm going to be Mr. Olympia.\" It's like that's too far away. It's too far away goal. You need a short-term goal. Like that's why we made this a 6 week challenge or Gym Shark had their 66 day challenge. I think it's not 66 weeks. That'd be long. But that idea of yes, our\ntransformation challenge is 6 weeks. But the goal is that the habits you build within those 6 weeks will carry on forever. The the progress you'll see and the momentum will keep you driving forward. I've spoken about that a lot in my Olympia preps. A momentum is absolutely everything. If I can ride a wave of momentum to the point where I'm four weeks out and everything starts to suck, I'm just falling forward at the end. If I have a shitty day, well, I've been moving so fast, so forward, so consistent, that nothing's going to stop me in one shitty day. You keep falling forward. So sometimes you got to grind it the [ __ ] out for a shortterm period, 6 weeks, whatever it may be. And then once you realize how much better you feel, you're like, \"Wait, I can do another week. I can do another week. I can do another week.\" Next thing you know, it's who you are. It's part of your life. It's a lifestyle, not just a short-term goal. Number six, most important rule of all. [Music] That's it. Time to work out. All [Applause] right. Last week, last week or last two week, last week was aiming for six reps. So, a little more weight, getting good volume, but because I'm at like the beginning of a training phase where I was off, now I'm back. I'm progressing really fast. So, the goal was to do six reps last week and then jump up to 8 to 10 reps with the same weight so that I'm getting more load. But that's the goal. I even bought these plate mates, which are supposed to be like do smaller in smaller smaller increments and put them on, but they don't work on the dumbbells. So, guess I'm going to be skinny for life. Six reps is a lot more fun than 10. But in all seriousness, I always talk about really specific things like tempo, 2.5 lb weight increases, specific progressive overload, periodization training, all this [ __ ] because it works and I love it. But at the end of the day, for 90% of you, you just have to get in and [ __ ] lift hard. If my 2.5 lb don't fit on the dumbbells, doesn't [ __ ] matter. I'm going to push myself heavier with more weight, get a little bit less reps, but if I'm pushing myself progressively harder and harder, you're still making gains. Like, no doubt, you can still win Olympios like that. I'm just passionate about learning about more nuances of how to continue to drive progress. Same thing with picking the best program. The best program is the one that you're going to adhere to the best. If I'm going through a phase where I'm like, I've been training for 10 years. I want to try very specific things that are proven to drive progress more. And that keeps me interested in training harder. Then it's working for me better than just doing focusing on just intensity. And eventually intensity is more likely to hit you with a plateau. If you're doing the same [ __ ] over and over and you're trying to do it harder and harder. So number one way to make gain gains is to train hard. Don't be a skinny [ __ ] But these little nuances in between can be fun and drive more progress. So don't overstress it. Do what you can. Just don't let it ruin the fun of the workout cuz getting jack can be fun some days unless it's leg day. Take strip away like all the crazy like systems and scienceback exercises and programming and [ __ ] And if you're not sleeping like none of those matter. Sleep is such a more important thing. Nutrition, consistency, effort is all such a bigger pillar than these little things. They're all fraction but when you stack fractions they're important. So when you have the pillars and you're stacking fractions on top of it, that's when you become elite. And we trying to be elite out here, not skinny [ __ ] Moving up to the big boy saddle weights. Moving my way back up to the 150s. Come on. That's the same weight as last week. About four more reps. Call that progress. Oh man, four sets of 10 is a lot of reps. It's like 80 reps between those two exercises. Come on. Come on. This is like a big day to really [ __ ] force build my like stabilizer press motion. Like stabilizing with a neutral grip all the way down. I can like feel like the part where my shoulder is still weak. It's healed, but it's weak. But doing four sets of incline and then three sets of flat dumbbell like this, it's a lot of stability [ __ ] So, I'm just like rebuilding that positioning and strength. And if I pull back on the kind of pressing volume and just focus on\nprogressing in load, then I have that stability to not get injured. [ __ ] jet. Hopefully Yes. Maybe it's also the fact I dumped a liter of blood this morning. Don't they tell you not to work out? Yeah. To get blood. Yeah. She was like, \"This is the most vials I've ever taken anybody.\" How much you weigh? She like looked me up and down. I'm like 300 lb. I'm like 250. She's like, \"You're good, sweetie. You're good.\" I was like, \"All right, sick. Thanks.\" So, I take that as I'm super human, so I can do whatever I want and I can still work out after even though I've only had a smoothie. Perfect. Chilling. Do you feel the strength coming back? Week by week, it's very small, but I definitely do. Even like what I noticed is like I would slowly feel like an increase of like stability which feels like strength. But now like from my first set to my last set, I still feel better going through it, which means I'm not like fully neurologically trained yet. Like my mind muscle connection isn't quite back yet. Because normally optimally your first set, you can expend the most amount of energy push amount of load and reps and then you get worse. But I'm kind of like getting better. Like even that last set, I came down for that first rep and I was just in the perfect motion where I loaded my pecs right and it just like bounced off and it felt way more fluid versus like the first rep my elbow was a little too bent. So I'm fighting a little bit here and I felt like a little like not in the right place. So just being in the right system and being trained like for form makes you feel a lot stronger. Which is why I always say when you're starting training, focus on form first and foremost cuz if you have perfect form when you start and then you get strong from there, so much better than doing it the other way. Trust me, I've been through [ __ ] multiple shoulder surgeries to talk about it. In the midst of that set, I was like, \"Oh, it feels kind of weird, but it also feels kind of good.\" Then I remembered I really haven't done like a fly like this since my shoulder injury. So, the fact I just jump on there and it definitely feels like iffy like stretching here and being a bit high stress is like I don't know if it's in my lab up in my bicep here or something, but one of the things is still tight, but it doesn't hurt like pain. Anyways, feels good to be able to do a kind of fly again. And I'm at the point where like that slight pain isn't enough to like hurt me and I'm going to have to work through it eventually. So, I'm not going to go super crazy, but adding this new fly motion into my arsenal of movements that I can do now post injury to really strengthen that muscle at every length that it needs to. So, do three sets of this. A little bit of trap three postural raises and get the [ __ ] out of here. Oh man. No. [Applause] All right, so we were just talking about how Hana used to give me [ __ ] because I hated setting my progress picks, especially at the beginning of my prep. My physique changes so much from like offseason fluffy to shredded. So, I just didn't like taking pictures like that. And this is something where even now I'm like, \"Oh, I haven't posed since Prague. I haven't done like a progress picture since I was in Prague.\" And I was on a fair amount of good supplements back then that do the trick. You know what I'm saying? Training a lot harder. I had no injury. Way different position than I am now. Considering retired, half natty seum, just [ __ ] coming back from injury, all these things. Leave myself out there right now. If you guys roast me, you're going to create huge self-image issues and I'm going to be [ __ ] shredded back on the Olympia stage in 6 months. So, do what you will with that. No, but seriously, I feel like it's a big thing of like people talk about like the Olympic athletes who get hella depressed after if they don't come back and find a goal. And that's why like I'm still pushing myself in training. I'm driven when it comes to being the best father I can in my family. That's like a huge like goal of mine that I'm actively working on rather than just being in that I have business. I still training all the things going on to keep me progressing cuz I came from such like an elite world of bodybuilding and then it was just gone and it was so revolved around how I look and then that's gone too that just fades. So, as much as I never wanted to attach my self-worth or\nanything to like how I looked and my appearance, it was kind of inevitable that I did because I own a sport that required that to some extent and I still was conscious of it as I was within it. So that when I was pulling away from it, I was aware of why I was feeling like things and I knew what I had to work through. But still, I'm human and that [ __ ] kind of happens. So, progress update right now. First time since like Prague, really. And I've been like training my ass off to be back in shape for this, too. So, I should have done this like right when I was injured because I put on almost 10 pounds of muscle and then I got a little bit leaner recently. So, I've been like back on diet for 4 weeks, training hard again for like a couple months and this is where we're at. Remember how to pose? Of course, I chose to do this after chest day, too. Damn, it hurts my adductors or whatever that is. I don't even know what a back job. I can't shave my back right now. It's classic post roll. There you have it. I'm honestly lightheaded right now. Damn, I haven't posed like that in a minute. But this is a pretty sick starting point for me coming off an injury. Like I said, I should have done this taking progress pics when I was like 10 lbs later post injury because I didn't. Looked like just flat even if I had lost all my muscle. I was way flatter. So, this is the starting point of me now ramping things up really seriously. My goals, I tell everyone, you have a goal to get very specific with it. And I'm struggling to get specific myself because I really want to get shredded, but I also haven't been training to build my strength back enough that I don't want to sacrifice my strength. So, I'm not leaning into a bulk phase. I'm like trying to get leaner without the sacrifice of strength is my goal. So, I'm going to keep feeding myself to which that I can perform in the gym to the level that I want where I'm progressing and load it every single week and getting stronger and stronger and stronger and I can recover from the right amount of intensity and volume that I want to, but I'm not just like jamming carbs down my face where to the point where I'm just like trying to bulk and get as strong as possible as fast as possible because I don't want to put on any more body fat than I am right now. So, the goal probably would be to be I'm 250 right now. The goal would probably be to be like three to four percent leaner than this at the exact same weight and stronger by the Olympia. That's probably what my like specific goal is for my physique to do right now. So, that's what I'm going to be working towards. Be talking about what my diet's like, doing a bunch of full days of eating. I'll be showing you guys my training. I'm going to be doing a different style of cardio now. Probably some steady state, some interval training because I just [ __ ] get bored doing steady state and I want to like really get my heart in good shape. So when I'm going to bed, my HIV is better and I'm just better conditioned. So a lot of cool stuff is coming. Yeah, that's it. I guess I feel like I could have rambled deeply about my [ __ ] ego death that I've gone through of my [ __ ] Mr. Olympia bodybuilder and being like, I'm not attached to how I look and my identity is not attached to my competing or winning or being a [ __ ] 250 lb shredded freak. And then when that started to fade, I was like, this doesn't feel good. I feel kind of like stressed. What what what's leaving me right now, you know? And I had this like conscious awareness of like that's what that was an ego death. I'm experiencing like a prolonged ego death of like letting go of the life that I used to live, the man that I used to be and kind of like expanding that where I'm not like attaching my identity to a thing and I'm just becoming who I am. I mean, I'm taking what I learned from that season of my life to become the man that I want to be, but my character of which I'm always in control of, but it's not attached to my performance or a trophy or a [ __ ] 250 lb shredded gorilla, silverback gorilla. But yeah, so maybe I'll [ __ ] ramble deeply into that another time, but for now, I got to get some food in me. So, nice little physique update on a hot summer day. Ah, this is going to be the thumbnail. Thanks for tuning in. Good [ __ ]"

    "text": "How to Build the Life You Want ? Transcript (Chris Bumstead) \nCompiled on October 28, 2025 \nI hope I'm not the only one who goes through phases where I absolutely suck at like hitting goals and being consistent essentially I realized that competing in the Olympia and being a bodybuilder I was going through so many phases where I would get super ramped up and prep be super consistent on a tight schedule a tight routine everything at the same time every day doing everything I needed and then I would kind of dip down right after the I would kind of fall off I'd go to the gym when I find the time but I didn't really have a routine so I would often skip days not feel great and I was giving myself a break and when I did that a lot of other things in my life were kind of falling off and then it would slowly ramp up in my offseason you know travel and business and work is kind of crazy and then it would get super dialed and locked in again for prep and I was just realizing that I was going through these phases and I was so efficient in prep and then very inefficient other times of the year so I wanted to take some of the habits and the mindsets and the things that I applied throughout prep that made me efficient and learn how to apply them to like my day-to-day life forever consistently so I kind of dove in for the last week or so just like reflecting and writing down some things that I did and my goal is to apply them to my life going forward forever and hopefully help you guys too so I'm not going to get into too deeply because I'll be sitting here for an hour and I wrote a [ __ ] lot of [ __ ] but I'm going to just tell you guys some things I put down and maybe it'll help you first thing is a clear goal obviously at the Olympia you know there's nothing more clear than a [ __ ] goal October 14th 2024 competing at the Olympia in Las Vegas like that's the goal I got to win the Olympia but this thing that always stuck with me super cheesy and I'm not going to get into deep cuz my mom was the one who taught it to me and you can find it online but it's called smart goals it stands for specific measurable achievable relatable and time base so specific you need a very specific goal not just like I want to be strong it's like how strong do you want to be at what date do you want to be strong what lifs do you want to be explosive strong do you want to be like powerlifter strong what are your specific goals measure obviously be able to measure it attainable has to be possible relatable has to be authentic to yourself something you care about time base there has to be a time base on it like I said I'm not going to get deep into that because you guys can Google that yourself but the big thing that I wanted to touch on here that I realized I applied into becoming Mr Olympian I think really helped me drive my success in my life was instead of having a goal necessarily like a thing that would end and then like the Olympia would fall off afterwards it was more of an identity a sense of self that I was trying to build and become someone who could complete X so the way I kind of worded it and I had written this down in one of the monologues they did before a prep Series without even realizing that was the way I think it's instead of I want to win the Olympia it's the goals you could write out to be more efficient I want to be someone who X so I want to be someone who trains consistently every single day hit sets to failure never Skips a meal never cheats on his diet gets his sleep and Recovery that he needs all the these different things like that and I thought that was so important and a huge thing for me within that was it wasn't just the actions and the physical things you did but your mentality the way you think\nthe way you treat people and all these things cuz you might think of the identity of the champion as someone who is a little bit you know edges on the side of arrogance super cocky confident and that's what winners do because a lot of people we see in the media are like that but that wasn't relatable or authentic to me so the self I wanted to betray before I was the champion was the humble respect full champion who treated everybody the same whether it was a former Mr Olympia backstage a stage Marshal a security guard whoever it might be the person the champion I wanted to be with someone who embodied that respect because I knew people would be looking up to me when I became this Champion not only for what I did but who I was and I wanted to be someone that my mom and their moms would be proud of if that's how they were acting so the next thing I kind of dove into here was you have an identity and then creating a list of things and defining very specifically what those people do and this comes back to that goal is I want to be someone who X so I want to be someone who you know what does Mr Olympia do and I you write that list down and you know you treat people with respect you're humble you go to the gym every single day whether it's to train or to do active recovering to stretch to hit ABS to hit your accessory body parts you know you never cheat on your diet and doing these things as much as possible the more you define these habits and you live these habits you will naturally become the success that you want to achieve so instead of chasing after that goal you become the identity and the person that will naturally attract that goal I think the biggest thing that people always come to me and ask me when I'm doing like meet and greets and they ask me it's always like how do I start what do I do how do I start I have all these things XY andz and you can watch a million YouTube videos read a million books and sometimes you get like overwhelmed by the amount of steps that are out there and and I mean nothing matters unless you actually do it so taking action is the most important hardest part you know I've always had this mindset that you are not what you think you're not who you think you are you just simply are what you repeatedly do so you can think positive things you can think this is huge in relationships you know like I could tell my my wife I think you're beautiful I think I love you I just don't say it well she's not going to know and feel it unless I show her with my actions and it's the same at anything in life so taking action is the most crucial point of everything and I think what people [ __ ] up is they get over overwhelmed with too many steps and things to do so this is going to be the most basic tip but the most important one if you take anything away from this build an identity and start [ __ ] small to build momentum those three things are everything when you break that down so for example when I used to be in college I used to drink three times a week get like blackout drunk go out with my friends and I loved it you know I love the social life I was in college hanging out with people was the only time my life had to be able to live like that and I was aware of that so I didn't want to sacrifice that so I did that for a period of time but then I wanted to take bodybuilding more seriously I was on the edge of going pro and I knew I had a lot of potential in me but I knew my lifestyle was holding me back but I also wasn't ready to sacrifice my social life yet so instead of just telling myself all right I'm going to stop drinking stop going out go to bed at 9:00 p.m. wake up at 6:00 a.m. do my cardio never miss a meal do all these things I was like I'm eating pretty good still cheating a lot cuz I like going out my friends and I love going out at night but I'm going to stop drinking so I still stayed out until 2 a.m. every night but I made one small change and that would to stop drinking and just that alone waking up not hung over and not wanting to eat bacon and [ __ ] God knows what else for breakfast CU you're hung over and tired and lazy having a bad workout horrible recovery from the alcohol throwing up your system I was able to make a decent amount of progress from that alone and the momentum I built from that one small change encouraged me to want to make more changes and eventually I stopped going out completely started\nto go to bed early I started to clean up my diet and I started to make all these little changes that eventually that literal year was the year that I turned Pro won two pro shows and made it to the Olympia just from making these subtle changes and it was huge and the one change I made made this Cascade effect into everything in my life and I think starting small in order to build momentum and being conscious that you were starting small intentionally to build momentum is huge so the goal when you're starting something especially if you're fresh the goal is to be consistent not perfect so create an identity Define what that person does start small and make your goal to pick something that you can be consistent with where imp perfect I don't need you achieve the whole list pick one start with that and with that momentum start another one and another one and another one and after a while once you're embodying these habits these actions and these behaviors without even thinking of your goal anymore you're going to achieve your goal as long as you're doing this like well thought out and the idea with momentum is I mean as anything if you're driving a car and you take your foot off the brake and you roll into a wall you're going to just [ __ ] tap into the wall [ __ ] up your car a little bit if you're driving 150 miles per hour at a brick wall and just [ __ ] fly right through that thing probably keep going there through at the other side you might you know get a little scratches on your car but you're still moving it doesn't stop you because you have so much momentum and that's the same thing with this after starting making those small changes when I was young and building these habits over time I didn't even feel like it was like I was dieting I didn't feel like I was eating healthy I didn't feel like I was training hard it was just life it who I was and it was what I did so when something came in the way whether I was in prep and it was my lat tear my hamstring tear 2018 when I was in the hospital you know last year I had a minor hamstring tear I didn't even really talk about it became the thing where I didn't even have a chance to hold me back because I had so much momentum had such an identity attached to behaviors that I did that when something came in to stop me I just kept rolling forward through it after so a lat tear would be something that would hold me back for a little bit and I'd be immediately back on my [ __ ] moving forward getting better and better and I can't stress that enough that momentum is like the secret to get through stuff cuz when things are so habitual that you don't have to think about them that when chaos hits in your life whether it be personal stressful mental emotional physical your habits you don't have to think about they take less energy so you just keep moving forward you keep getting better better and it's [ __ ] everything all right so the next little tip amongst all these all are kind of the actionable steps but the other thing that I realized I did without knowing it is selft talk and like personal accountability I tie these in together because how you talk to yourself is sometimes how you hold yourself accountable but personal accountability means you're responsible for your own life which means you are Empower you have the power to control and change your life so personal accountability equals power power is the ability to do whatever the [ __ ] you want in your life so no one else wants you to [ __ ] hit your goals like you do no one cares what you do Beyond yourself so make sure you're holding yourself accountable you're not waiting for someone else to encourage you you're waiting for someone else to go to the gym do this or that you really have to hold yourself accountable you know it's in the selft talk piece a little thing that I this is how I label it now but I wasn't intentionally doing it in purpose in the time but I was always talk to myself in my head like I was a mentor talking to my Apprentice you know there's always like your thoughts in your mind and then there's the thinker of the thoughts you know there's two kind of when you're talking to yourself in your head there's someone talking and then there's someone paying attention so there's kind of two like dualistic identities inside your brain at any given time and I viewed it as like a mentor who is the retired six-time Mr Olympia talking to the amateur The Apprentice who\nwanted to become that and was embodying that and working towards that so when I would talk to myself like come on champ come on you want to be Mr Olympia like let's get after it it was like my future Mr Olympia self talking to myself and when I would be on a treadmill I'd be supposed to do 30 minutes 25 minutes goes by I'm like add bored tired want to go eat breakfast deep in prep whatever and I get off I'd get off and talk to myself like come on champ like is that what Mr Olympia does is Mr Olympia to get out five minutes before his cardio's done I'm like [ __ ] and I drag myself back on finish my cardio and actually do it right same thing with you know a set if I'm aiming for 10 I get eight and I just put the weights down and I'm like what the [ __ ] like you could have gotten 10 maybe I Take 5 minutes do another set that I'm not even supposed to do to hit that 10 just to hold myself accountable or I get right back on and do two more three more reps just to make sure I'm hitting that 10 that I was supposed to but holding yourself accountable and having the proper self talk is important and I don't think this comes from shame I don't think shaming yourself calling yourself a piece of [ __ ] like you fat [ __ ] get after it all these things I don't personally believe that works at all I think if you call yourself a fat [ __ ] and you begin to identify as a fat [ __ ] you will continue to act like a fat [ __ ] so not to use fat shaming as an example at all but that's a huge one that people do you know that eat bad [ __ ] I'm so fat I'm so fat I'm going to keep eating bad like no it's don't shame yourself positive reinforcement talk to yourself from like a oneup position in a positive form hold yourself accountable to be better not to shame yourself for being worse I think that's absolutely huge positivity is [ __ ] massive and I think so many people think driving forward from shame works because it does for a period of time but if you're trying to be a six-time Mr Olympia or do something consistently I truly believe that everything I just listed of building identity a habits a self-accountability the positive selft talk those are the only ways to properly sustain things obviously within that you know the goal of everything I'm talking about I'm trying to focus more on like mental things and the mental side of things and even in the behavior something I didn't mention if I was like Mr Olympia is someone who always has their head on right what does someone who has their head on right do you know they self-reflect they Journal they go to therapy they talk about their emotions and their feelings they let things out they don't hold it all in and these were all part of the identity that I began to build to be create a mind set that could do anything rather than just trying to accomplish one thing and I think that was the most important thing that I kind of naturally built over time and I didn't even realize what I was doing I was just again starting small and building habits creating identity around something I wanted to be knowing I wanted to be Mr Olympia and embodying that next thing I knew I was [ __ ] looking back retiring and I had done it six times and I was like wow like you did it and it was pretty cool so you know there's a lot of these things that I'm going to try to apply to absolutely everything in my life such as you know being a good father defining what that means to me being someone who you know is present when his kids around is emotionally there for his daughter is you know drives them to their games leaves work early because priority is family these little things that are important to me something that I want to Define so I know who I want to be and I'm aware of it and then I can actually act and live it out so yeah that's pretty much it but essentially clear outcome clear goal Google smart goals I don't need to do that consistent identity Define what that identity is start small build momentum and just [ __ ] create an identity be someone who X and Define that very specifically not I want to be jacked I want to be someone who and what are the attributes that you would view as someone who is jacked use that as an example obviously because it's easy for me to use selft talk being positive personal accountability it all comes down to yourself you know I don't even repeat myself it is what it is but yeah this is something that I've been personally reflecting on and I just wanted to share that with you guys I think you know there's a\nlot of lessons that I learned that I didn't even understand I was learning and you know there's two times to learn from something it's from the experience and then from reflecting on the experience and I think from reflecting on the experience is when you truly are able to learn and make changes to your life going forward because the greatest achievement of accomplishing your goals isn't the goal it's who you become and accomplishing those goals so I want to do my best to be able to share a lot of the things I did hopefully help you guys move forward and as I doing my self-reflection on the experience I just lived I'm going to try and kind of share these little tidbits if you will with you guys so sorry for the rant hope that made sense I tried to I literally have like five bullet points on my phone that I'm going off from a 10 minute video however long I'm talking so hopefully it made sense but appreciate you guys thanks for watching"

    "text": "Leg Day ? Slump to Lock-In (Transcript) \nWhat is up, YouTube? Still pretty smoked \nright now. I have been taking \npre-workout every day and I just took a \nscoop of essential on the way here and \nI'm like feeling a little tingly and \nbeta alanine and I love the feeling. So, \nhopefully it gets me rolling. Rocking at \nleast a heaping scoop of EA and it's leg \nday today, so I took some carb powder as \nwell with some electrolytes and whatnot \nin there because it is smoking hot in \nthe gym. But honestly, I would say like \nI'm smoked right now to be completely \nhonest. And it's I mean to get like \nactually real for a moment like life is \nbeautiful and there's a lot going on but \nlike there's been so many changes in my \nlife recently especially like from the \nretirement of competing and like how \nmuch purpose and passion I had from such \na sole goal to like pulling away from \nthat to then like the change in like \nwhat also was a big part of my life \nwhich is social media and then also now \nhaving like a child which is like the \nmost beautiful thing ever but also takes \naway your free time and then we go on a \ntrip and I didn't I like literally \nliterally didn't sleep on the trip. Like \nI was so tired and I don't sleep very \nwell. I don't know if I' I've complained \nabout this enough on my YouTube \nprobably, but like when I don't sleep \neven when I sleep even worse than I \nnormally do, my body just like shuts \ndown and I really lose like a lot of \nlike mental drive and like I don't know \nif it's like the dopamine or just too \ntoo high of cortisol. Like even my \nmemory has been off. Like recollection \nof words had been falling off. And I got \nback from our trip and the night before \ngoing in the office I was like up \nanxious thinking. I was like, I just\ntook 2 weeks off, 3 weeks off, and now I'm coming back in. I have all this [ __ ] I have to do behind on this. I haven't worked out. I haven't done this. I have to do this. I have to film. I have to [ __ ] do all these things and I was just up thinking and anxious. And then I slept worse. And then the next night, Bradley was up all night cuz she was sick and I slept worse again. And I'm just like, it builds up over time. So, all this to say, pretty much \nI still am [ __ ] very human. And having less of a concrete goal of like the Olympia, I feel like I've like lost a lot of like drive and passion right now. It's honestly been challenging for me to like show up and like perform for like YouTube or show up to work and do everything I need to do, go to trips and meet people and do the things and all that stuff when I'm not feeling like my best self. You know, it's one thing if I'm like feeling shitty and I can just like go sit at home alone, but like there's a lot of front-facing things I have to do to like perform. And sometimes that even sucks the life even more out of me. So, I don't really have an answer for how to solve this if you guys are going through that. But people who are like going through moments of feeling like they have less drive and less passion for their life. You're not alone. I'm in the exact same position right now. All I can say that I've done in the past I'm trying to do right now is figure out what I need like what my personal like soul needs to make myself feel better. And I know it's sleep, it's consistency, it's routine, it's healthy food. And I feel like when people fall off and they're not sleeping and they feel shitty, you're more likely to like binge Tik Tok and Instagram and eat shitty food cuz you just want to like find good comfort in other places, but\nthat just drives you even farther down. So the people who actually able to pull themselves out of these slumps are the one who when they at least feel like it, they can still show up to the gym and crush a leg day. They're still going home and eating healthy rather than shitty food. They're staying off their phone. They're going to bed when they can. Like doing all the things that make you feel better. So I'm trying to \ncontrol all the little things that I can in my life right now. It's a season where there's a lot going on. There's a season where I have no free time to myself because I have a a baby and businesses and content and things I got to do and it is what it is. So, just kind of doing the little things I can to take care of what I need. Whether it's like a moment alone, a sauna, reading a book that I'm like passionate about instead of going on my phone, driving my car instead of needing to listen to an audiobook, listen to some music and rolling the windows down and just having a moment to relax cuz that drive home is my only moment alone that I have. So the little things that help, \nhopefully they help. And then over time, you come out of your slump. It's just a season of life. You're not always going to be going up. Sometimes you're just [ __ ] trudging through mud and sand and muck and all that stuff. So kind of where I'm at right now, \nbut it's leg day, so I got to lock the [ __ ] in and I got to hold myself accountable to do the hard [ __ ] So we're going to go train some legs, get after it, and yeah, got to do front squats today, so that's going to be tough. But we're gonna do it good in the cold gym. \nBut I could use a month of hot yoga. My next YouTube video will be I did hot yoga for 1 month. This is what happened\nand I'll feel incredible. \nI haven't done squats in so long I like forget how to warm up. Last time I used to warm up squats, I put one plate, two plate, three plate, four plate, five \nplate, and just go. Those days are long behind me. \nDamn, \nthis is way more taxing on my core. This is one of those combos of like when you're not recovered and unslept, my ability to like push through a hard set of breathing really heavy after. But also, I haven't really done a lot of \ncore stabilizing things. I probably have the strength in some areas of my body to move more weight, but like my core and lower back holdings right now is like, \"Holy [ __ ] like this is heavy on me.\" Whereas in the past when I used to deadlift like six plates every week, I could put four plates on my like a front squat and just be like locked in. Now I'm like wobbly and all insecure. My body's insecured. But yeah, so I got to rebuild all that right now. Rebuild the strong core, strong foundation, and all the lifts around to get stronger. \nFeel \nlike it's my first time ever working out doing this. Like putting it back \ncrooked, feeling all lopsided. My core is more sore than my legs. Kind of feels good to be a beginner at something again, though. Sucks when it doesn't. But I like knowing that a the amount of work I put in my body the last few years, I adapt quick. But I know when you're really shitty at something and it comes down to like stability and form, every week you can progress so much more because it just comes from consistency, not so much just the strength you're building. So going to put another 5 lbs on next set. Hopefully next week I can start heavier and be even stronger at this.\nWhen you were at your toughest moments in the Olympia, where were you finding like motivation for the workouts. \nI feel like the difference when I was training for the Olympia was like the momentum I had behind me. Like when you have such a big goal behind you, it's not just like, oh, I'm a week out. It's time to start trying. It's like the year prior. It's building up momentum of like, okay, off season take a break. Off season get stronger, get your food better. And you're like building up all these good habits on the way to the point where you have so much momentum of progress and consistency that like when you have a tough day, the moment momentum just like falling forward. you just keep progressing and you have like such a strong goal ahead of you, you know, like I had such like a singular mission in my life, which is I think \npart of the reason why now I kind of feel lost too cuz it's it's like a \nbusiness. It's like bum energy all we sell bum energy whereas raw we have like 50 SKs. So it's a lot more complicated to like pay attention to each skew \nversus selling one thing. When you have one goal that you're focused toward is just head down and work towards it. And then when life usually isn't that \nsimple, you have so much other stuff going on. For me at least, being used to that other capacity, it's harder to stay stuck. So I think when I was in the Olympia, it was pretty much the momentum I'd built from consistency and just like the singular passion of drive just to get a singular goal. Like I wanted to be the best in the world, best bodybuilder on stage. And every day was just like waking up with that mission. So probably right now part of what I feel lost is I don't wake up with like a mission every day. kind of like, you know, and that's on me. The habits I need to create are\nlike, okay, if I have a lot of [ __ ] I got to get done, weekends, family, nighttime, family, Monday to Wednesday, standard, Wednesday to Friday, raw, thumb, energy, shoot, plan here. Like, I need to be a little bit more structured, especially the way I operate \nis like I'm not like one of those like pure dopamine driven people who wants to just like [ __ ] run through walls all the time. I'm more of like a mellow, calm, laid-back person. So I don't thrive in the chaos the same. I can handle it. But I do better in like \ncontrolled structure, which isn't always an option for life, especially when you have a child. But I think maintaining as much as you can, \nis a lot better. If my goals are \nsleeping and training and X at the same time, at least if I know that, I feel \nokay, I have that structure over here. When everything else falls apart, I at least have this. So balancing all that \nstuff. And honestly, in the last year, and this morning was an example, I was like feeling overwhelmed. And then Bradley like had a rough couple nights, but she wakes up in the morning happy. She's like, she wants to play all the time now. So, I'll come out and I'll be like I'll look at her like I'm like \ntired. She sees me. She's like, and then she turns and just runs. And like the way a baby runs is hilarious. Or like they're horrible like form. They \nprobably run better than me, honestly. I can't talk [ __ ] But then I can't not be in a good mood, you know? Like what the [ __ ] am I stressing about when this little baby that I love so much is \nhappy, you know? like it puts things into perspective. So I said in the last video too, but like marriage and family is like the most important thing and I think having that is just such a \nbeautiful thing to be grounded to keep\nyou grounded. So very blessed. \nBut also need huge legs. So time for some Bulgarian split squats. \nHeat. \nHeat. \nThink \nI need an extra fan in Here. This corner is missing some airflow. \nWow. \nMy head is spinning after these sets. Yeah, a little lightheaded and like I go lightheaded like see white and then this like pulse of like blood to my brain and I'm like whoa. \nWoo! \nBradley was sick and we were she like couldn't function. She was just like so out of it. We normally don't let her watch TV, but we put on some old school Disney movies. \nWe watch Tarzan and Little Mermaid. Sick movies, but it's hilarious as an adult now. Some like the weird like \na like racist sexual innuendos that are in there. And then like Ariel in Little Mermaid is like I think she was 16 years old and just like 12 inch waist like bra with like cleavage and then like hips and then this like looks like \n30-year-old dude on land pursuing this like [ __ ] adolescent teenager. I'm like, this feels so strange, you know? And in Tarzan, too, like everyone's physiques are just so [ __ ] crazy. Yeah. \nYou know, it's pretty nuts. Especially the women like Pocahontas \njust like chiseled jawline, snatched waist, teenager again, like busting out like \nand I can't remember the guy's name in Pocahontas, but the dude's like talking about his escapades, killing savages, i.e. like Native Americans and then he goes and falls in love with one. I'm like this is crazy. Times have changed. But like lowkey reality though, it's\nkind of the way things used to be. So like \nmy opinion, it doesn't help to hide your kids from reality. You expose them to it, but you teach them what's right and what's wrong and the way to approach things, rather than putting them in a bubble where like you pretend like stuff doesn't exist, which it does. So I don't know. It is what it is. I'm going to have to figure out how the [ __ ] to manage that [ __ ] Bradley can understand what they're saying. \nI mean, it's all the same movie that we watched growing up and we all turned up. Okay. \nArguably fine. \nDepends on the day. \nSomeone brought up like South Park and I'm like that was crazy. \nSouth Park is \ngrowing up with kids with South Park. Like \nthat was some brutal comedy. That's why we all have like such dark, crude senses of humor, you know, which turned into like the next generation of like \nmillennials being I guess we're kind of millennials, whatever that next \ngeneration is where they're like coddled and so offended by everything and we're like we grew up with South Park like nothing bothers us. \nThis workout's hitting all the tempos. Had the front squat, six reps at the beginning. The middle two Bulgarian and leg curl were 10 reps. And then I'm finishing with 20 reps on the leg press. So, just getting the body ready to do some work. It's a very random super set. I'm doing ab rollers and leg press. So, I'm I never train abs consistently \nenough. I feel like I've said that for a decade of my life. But, if I'm trying to be an athlete, I need a good core. So, going to be doing a little ab roll out. See if I can still do these.\nI don't know if I'm the only person who gets this. It's really just my abs. If I don't train them consecutively and then I train them again, I can like tell they're just about to cramp. And if I go anywhere close to failure, if I like sit down in my car or bend down to put my shoe on or something, my abs just like seize and cramp so bad. \nSo, I have to like really work myself back up to it. \nOr I'll just make myself cramped and show you guys so you can laugh at me crying like a little [ __ ] \nWhen I was in crap, I made it till like end of August training in here when it was even hotter and I was training way harder. It was one day I had a heat stroke in here. I don't know if that's the right word, but I got sick. I got like nauseous. I got like a little flu from being over like exhausted and overheated. And then Hani was like, \"All right, you no more training legs in your gym. go get somewhere with air conditioning. So, if I made it to August in prep, I can't be a skinny [ __ ] right now. [ __ ] July. \nIt's the last day of July, isn't it? \nTomorrow's the last day. \nTomorrow's the last day of July. We got plenty of time. \nAll right, that is a wrap on today's leg and ab workout. \nStuck on the floor right now. \nThis is another prime example. I started the video talking about like \nlife's chaos, stuff out of your control, being overwhelmed, stuff that keeps me on track, routine, balance, family, slow, intentional time, whatever. But nothing really beats a really good workout. I mean, my family beats a really good workout. Bradley's better than a leg day, obviously. But like, not many people can deny if you're having a shitty day and you come in and you train\nhard, you sweat. Even if it's not the best workout ever, but you push yourself, you get your blood rate, your heart rate going, blood flowing, \nsweating, you just feel better. I'll say it till I'm blue in the face, but just a huge advocate that for someone's life feels out of out of whack and you're just trying to get your [ __ ] together, you don't know what the [ __ ] to do, just start working out. Start with something small that might not be in the direct direction you want to be, but at least clears your head to feel better to move on and do the things you need to do. Build discipline, all that [ __ ] Just a huge fan of working out. I don't think my career was meant to inspire people to bodybuild cuz bodybuilding, especially competitively, is pretty [ __ ] up \nmentally, physically, everything. But weight training and working out, if I inspire people to get in the gym and make themselves better there, \nI think it's a beautiful thing to help your life."

    "text": "Back in America ? Wedding Reflections & Workout (Transcript) \nDate: 2025-11-03 \nAll right. What is up, YouTube? We are finally back in America. I was on a two week hiatus going around Europe. Had my official wedding. Technically, I've already been married for like two years, but we had a official wedding rather than just a courthouse celebration that we had before. We're down to Italy. Small wedding. Had like eight people there. Then we did a little trip to Austria after with Bradley. And then we went to Paris after that. It was a great trip, but I don't recommend traveling with a toddler, especially like 15 months when she's just becoming a toddler and she did not want to sleep. She got sick. We all got sick. It was chaos, but it was honestly really nice to have like intentional time together. I can finally wear a ring now. I've been married, but I haven't worn a ring because we wanted to have the official wedding to do this. Not to get super cheesy with you guys, but it's had me reflecting a lot about like love and marriage and all that kind of stuff. And I feel like there's a lot of skepticism amongst people that I talk to around it. or like at least a lot of people which makes sense given like divorce rates are like just under 50% now which means if you're in a relationship of two people I hope or maybe you're by yourself or three I don't know then odds are even higher 50% chance of divorce rate there's a pretty much a high rate that one of you guys parents had a divorce so your idea of a relationship ends in divorce and people don't trust institutions no one trusts the government people don't trust religion people don't even trust family structures anymore so it's become this like negative thing around it but we live in a society that really like pushes is like individuality and like self-made selfish pursuits like gain, make money, do stuff. Especially like men even are like don't be vulnerable, don't lean on people, like be the strong person who provides but don't need anything, just don't need anything ever. it's like this whole mistrust of things. And I feel like that's trickled into like marriage. And even if it's something that's broken in our society, I don't think there's something that's wrong with it in that sense. I think maybe our society might be hurting because stuff like that is broken. long- winded way to say having the wedding, writing our vows, having the moments of just like so much focus on love. I feel like it made me really reflect that like the most beautiful thing I've really built in my life is my marriage and my relationship with Courtney. And everything is going to fade. The body that I build and work for every day, the money you make, the business you have, it all fades. But if you do it right, your relationship is the one thing where at the end of life, it is at its strongest, best point ever. And I think there's something so beautiful, especially like me, like I talk about society, the push to be individualistic or whatever. That was me. I was like convincing Courtney when we were young that you don't need anyone. You don't need anything. Relationships are nice, but you don't need your partner and all this stuff. And learning over time, especially with her help of like how important and helpful it is to have someone that you trust in every capacity to like lean on when time gets hard and to share everything that you have going on with. It's everything in life. But when I really think of like everything I have going on in my life, if I lost all of it, but I had Courtney and Bradley, I'd be great. And there's so much like peace in my heart and safety and security that I have in that. And I just think it's something that so many people are missing. And\nit's it's hard. It's probably the hardest thing that you can build in the relationship. But instead of it being something that like traps you, it actually creates more like peace and freedom in your life. It creates more like security. You know, someone who can actually hold you accountable. They're not holding you back from growth. They're actually creating a mirror for you to see your faults in yourself of places where you can get better. And if you have a partner like Courtney who holds me accountable when I'm not being my best self, trust me, I have points I can be an [ __ ] It definitely happens where I blurt out things I don't mean and she holds me accountable and I'm able to look and reflect and repair the relationship through it and find why it's coming out of me and why it's getting put onto her. I think there's nothing in my life more that's made me grow than my relationship with her to make me become a better person, a better father, a better everything. And I think just having someone where you know I think why the marriage is so important to me is because you're committing that no matter what you're not giving up on each other. Like in a life where everything is so temporary right now like stuff is so fleeting. Marriage is like the one thing where no matter what like we're going to figure it out. We might go through hell, go through hard times, go through fights, but always if our goal is at the end we will always be together then we need to repair along the way and continue to work towards that common goal of being together. other. And I just think there's something so beautiful about that of just like an absolute like I wear this vow on my hand that like I will always put you first. I will always take care of our relationship. There's so much meaning in that. And I think it's just so important to have somebody in your life like that where when everything else is cha chaotic and going home, you have your rock, which is your your wife and your partner. And I think in just our world right now, it's something that's really missing for people don't really put the same effort they put into like pursuing their fitness or building a [ __ ] million-dollar business or all this stuff that they do their relationship, which ultimately brings you your most fulfillment and happiness. So, that was a huge reflection I've been having since getting married. And the our wedding was beautiful. It was so small with eight people. I I wrote my vows in the morning by hand and it really had me like thinking and reflecting of how important all these things, these promises I was making, everything we've been through with each other, how all this stuff was. And then there was this moment at the wedding. I had some drinks in me. It was a bit of an emotional day. Don't judge me. This is me already pre-lighting this. But we had a live band there and the girl was [ __ ] such a good singer and she started singing Creep by Radio Head, which you wouldn't think is emotional song, but she made it way deep and I started crying cuz the song was just so beautiful. And I like turned away from my family and me and Courtney were sitting here and I just like was like looking at her trying to like hide back my tears cuz like I don't want to cry in public, you know? I'm vulnerable but I'm still working on it, right? Give me some grace. But it was like such a subconscious moment where like I realized like she's my safe space even around my family. Like when I have tears in my eyes and I feel vulnerable, I turn to my wife because I know the way she sees me with pure love forever is my safe place to just be myself in whatever capacity that that is. And just those little moments are just so important. And I'm like, as much as life gets crazy and I'm trying to get jacked and win Olympias and do all these things, like it comes down to that being the most important thing. And that really keeps me grounded. Such a beautiful thing. And I really just want, as much as I talk about like getting jacked and pursuing beautiful things in life, I also want something that I inspire people to do is to build a meaningful lasting relationship and a beautiful family that they love and to really be a voice of reason. That that is the most important thing\nin life. Like that's the most important thing to build and to focus on. So yeah, that's my long- winded dad rant for the day. Now we're going to get jacked because that's also very important. So getting in the gym. I haven't I have had two workouts back home, so I'm getting back to it since the trip. I was \neating pretty good. I had pizza and baguettes and croissants and toast and [ __ ] bread and sausage and bacon every single day, but it's okay cuz food's better in Europe. I trained like twice a week and when I was training I was just going really hard and really long and heavy in volume and just everything just to keep from losing muscle. So now we're kind of rebuilding back a little bit. I'll explain more what I'm doing my programming right now. But going to get in the gym, get jacked and get back to it cuz it's time to lock it the [ __ ] in. No more traveling, no more [ __ ] I'm over this injury. Olympia is coming up. I'm like 10 weeks out of not competing, but I still want to be jacked. So lots coming on. Time to get a gym again. Workout It is hot in here. It's like 100? outside right now. Still no AC in the gym. I know you guys keep saying it's all AC, but like I don't want to, so I'm not going to. And at least it makes my shoulder feel better. But update right now. Training goal right now is increasing work capacity. So was doing some hydro hypertrophy before obviously took took like 3 weeks off. Got sick traveling training what I could but my work capacity is really low right now. So if I'm going to jump in do 100 lb dumbbells for a set of 10 the next set I'll probably fall off super quick. So instead of doing like two to three working sets right now I'm doing like a lower volume four working sets just to rebuild that work capacity for my body so that in the future when I'm pushing I can get better. everything from your muscle endurance, your heart, cardio, nervous system. It takes a while for it to like rebuild to be able to train hard for a long period of time. You can go all out for one set, but you want to be able to go all out for a long workout. That's how you make the most gains. So, currently right now, that's the goal. We're going to be adjusting as time goes on, but starting off some shoulder press and some lat pull down. My shoulder has been getting a lot better. Maybe taking some time off vacation was good for it. Also, just started taking a bunch of peptides again. the good old BPC57 TV500 putting it right there in my shoulder and I was taking it at the beginning of my injury. I've taken it through my whole prep, but I was taking the beginning of my injury, but it was so injured I felt like it wasn't helping and I just got defeated and stopped. Just started taking it again about a week ago and I feel like my shoulders felt better in a week already. So hopefully everything is going to come together and start to get healthier. So we'll see. But I am doing shoulder press. I was doing on vacation neutral grip. People are asking why it hurts my shoulder less. That's why. It's really my only reason. So, I'm keeping it close. And then a neutral grip pull down for the opposite motion. Antagonist super set. I'm going to go do it. All right. Heat. Heat. M More The goal of this part is sending load, keeping it 10% intensity spread. And this is why we just launched this thing for my app, Standard Plus. It's like this community with extra education and weekly calls with Justin and some with myself cuz there's the little nuances to training where if you really care a lot more results. But in this phase of me trying to build work capacity, my goal is to start off with a load where I can get like six reps relatively easily and then ascending load. So go heavier or if I don't have the small enough weight increments to do a little bit more reps, like one more rep throughout the sets rather than going down. So ascending load, you're going up in load as you go on between the sets. and going doing that over four sets just allows your body to get used to pushing more and more and more throughout the workout rather than less and less and less. So that's the goal of this one. Same thing on both. It's a four sets of six reps, 3 second negative and then just explo explosive out of the bottom. So that was technically a 10%\nintensity spread ascending load from the beginning. Close enough. 10 lb from 90 is close enough to 10%. So, guess that weight pretty good. I got one more set. I got to hit another six or so reps and then next week maybe I'll start with the hundreds and try and work up from there. Progressive overload. Come on. Come on. There's nothing better than sets of six. That's a golden number right there. It's not too short where you're going to kill yourself doing one or two reps. It's not so high like 10 plus reps where you're just tired and mentally fatigued by the end. It's just like the perfect like tired by four reps, push hard through two. See you later. A lot more fun. It was funny being in we were in France at the end of our trip and I mean we all know it so I'll just say it. French people have a reputation of being rude and we experience some rude French people. But maybe it's cultural differences. So, I'm not going to label them as rude. But you can tell it's not cool to try there. Like trying to be nice or outgoing or like styling your outfit too hard or being jacked essentially like you're trying too hard something is not cool. It's like that old school version of when you're in school and you're like I don't want to try anything not cool. I feel like that's what defines Paris at least Parisians if you will. That defines them what I experience. People are going to get mad at me even saying this, but I don't give a [ __ ] But I could tell there's no gyms there. There were like no gyms in Paris. No one's works out. No French people were jacked. They were looking at me and they're probably like, \"Why the [ __ ] do you waste so much time in the gym? Like you try too hard.\" They were like looking at me like I was a freak walking around the streets. And I have significantly downsized from what I was. So there's an interesting difference in culture to say the least. Everyone's wearing like dope outfits, but like minimalist black, just like nice pants, nice shirt, like super simple, skinny, smoking cigarettes, and eating croissants. They don't eat croissants every day, but they do smoke a lot of cigarettes. So, it was interesting. No jack people in Paris. So, if you want to feel huge, walk around the streets of Paris to feel jacked. It's hot. I feel like I'm bad at this, but of like communicating things that aren't helpful. I can't remember. I think it was like Ben Berseron in a CrossFit book coach with like one of the top female Icelandic girls probably. They were doing like a winter workout and he made her go do like a run outside and she came inside and he was like, \"How was it?\" She's like, \"Cold?\" He's like, \"Oh, do it again.\" She ran out, came back in, did it again. He's like, \"How was it?\" She's like, \"Still cold.\" He's like, \"Go do it again. How much?\" And then she came back in the third time. He's like, I'm paraphrasing here, but it's like, how was it that time? She's like, good. You're like, all right, you're done. It's like teaching her mentally to not focus on the things that are making things harder. Don't vocalize that it's hot, that you're tired, that it's cold out. Just shut up and do the work. Some people are impacted that a lot more by others. But the brain, the body goes where the brain goes. So, got to keep my ass from bishing by this heat in here. I'm grateful for the heat. Heat makes my shoulder feel better. So, I love the heat. Makes me perform better. [Applause] It's cold in here. I've never progressively done like a neutral grip, elbows tucked press. I'll like throw it in partway through my workout with like lighter weight when I'm already fatigued and I don't do that consistently. So now that it's like way better for my shoulder and I'm doing it more, I'm curious if I'll ever be able to get up to the 150s like that. Cuz traditionally I've just been way weaker like that because I haven't done it. So if I can press the 150s as a natty sebum, half natty sebum with that kind of form, I'd be fired up. Then I'd have a huge chest hopefully. Come on. Come on. Come on. It hurts. Yeah. All right, that's a wrap on today's workout. First week out. First workout back from vacation. Like 11 weeks out the Olympia that I'm not competing in. Got what's going on in life right now. We have a transformation challenge for my\napp. Trans. Holy [ __ ] What the [ __ ] did I just say? We have a transformation challenge for my app launching on August 14th, 16th, 17th. We've changed it multiple times, but it's around that time in this third week of August. So, I'm going to be [ __ ] trying to get shredded and jacked throughout that. Building up towards that right now. It's kind of what's going on right now. So, we'll be updating you guys on more of that to come for sure. Maybe I'll do a little bit of physique update to come. You can see see what I look like post vacation. But other than that, I got to go do a shoot right now so you guys can tag along for that. We got some food delivered to the gym. I got a nice bison wrap here. I haven't eaten since breakfast. So, I've had like four scoops of EAS today because I was not planning on training this late. So, I'm going to get some real food in me, go do this shoot. I'm probably not going to have time to shower now, so I'll be sweating and disgusting, but you guys can't smell RAW Anniversary me on the camera, so it is what it is. She got sick, then we got sick and she got We weren't that long after we got into the vitamin shop and we're like rolling and it was just like go go go. But like it was us like four people sitting behind a laptop just watching the Shopify tip. Never like compared to other we care about like our creativity comes from such different spaces, you know, like clothing or, you know, stuff that has nothing to do with sports. So, like, yeah, we all love to work out. We love good quality products, but like when we're building a campaign or it's not like, oh, like we need to do that, then we need it's we're just doing what we like. Our ability to like just make a decision because we wanted to before and if it failed and be like, oh, whatever. Like, we'll fix it. Now, the decisions are [ __ ] massive. All right, so we just had a shoot for RAW. It was just like a little interview with me, Dom, and Matt. August is our fifth anniversary, so it's our birthday month. And we're gonna be doing a really cool like sale celebration, birthday thing for RAW. But we were just sitting down talking and reminiscing of like the start of the business and stuff that we've been through over the years. And it's pretty crazy sitting back and thinking about that stuff. Like I reflect a lot about how crazy life is now, but I don't often look back and really remember like all the crazy [ __ ] we've been through to get here. So pretty cool to sit and talk about that stuff. It's insane that it's been like five years of building this company and thinking where we started in the back of a little gym to the other warehouse to this warehouse to be on this warehouse and everything. It's crazy. So, lots of cool stuff changing. Got that big sale coming up in August. We're working on some really [ __ ] good athletes that we're signing. We just signed Terrence and Keon. So, we got the 212 champ, best poser in the game right now, Terrence Ruffin, and some incredible competitors. Both champions in their own regards. So, super excited about that. leaning into the bodybuilders, top of the top of the sport. I can't be on stage this year, but we're collecting some other guys. We also got some more people that I can't talk about yet that we're working on. Top influencers, not bodybuilders. Maybe some more bodybuilders, but we're going to [ __ ] explode the raw athlete program this year. It's going to be crazy. And then we're going to start busting up more events. Dope [ __ ] The Olympia this year, it's going to be a great end of the year. So, yeah, there's lots of stuff going on. Fill you guys in as they come and as things go. Hopefully. I was out of town for the last 3 weeks and all the athletes came and trained and were filming and I didn't get to see any of them, but we bring him back every couple of months just to shoot content, work out, shoot the [ __ ] and all the stuff. So, I'll try and hop in with some workouts with them in the future. But that's kind of a quick update of what's going on right now. And I got to get home and eat some food. So, thank you guys for watching. I'll see you later. All right, one last Transformation Challenge thing to wrap up this video. We're having a transformation\nchallenge. We're going to be giving away $15,000 in prizes. And this is for myself as much as anyone else. This is important to me because I'm going to be doing this one too. Since retiring from the Olympia, I haven't had that same like passion and drive towards like doing the things I know I need to do. And in not doing that, which for me starts in the gym with my nutrition, the rest of my life still feels a little bit blah and just like even more anxious and just not there properly. So, the goal of this challenge is called Standard Six, the shift. It's a six week challenge. The winner is going to get a $10,000 prize pack, $5,000 in prizes, $5,000 in cash straight in your pocket. And then the runner up is 2500,500. And then we're also going to have an overall transformation challenge or winner besides just the the winners. And there's guidelines on how to win and everything. Every single person is going to get access to our standard plus weekly phone calls. So Justin's on all them. I hop on all them that I can going over nutrition, all these things like that, diet, training, everything. you guys can ask questions in the Q&A; on the end. And then on top of that, you're going to get a PDF on cutting, diet, everything you guys need to know, access access to the training, the macro calculator, and of course, the incentive of the prizes. And the goal of this is more than just diet. Essentially, we're actually going to be giving you guys a list of habits to add to your life, and you're going to be choosing six of those. So, it's six weeks, six habits. Me, six time Mr. Olympia. I'm not getting seven this year, so I need this for myself. But these habits are meant to put you in a position where you need to succeed. A lot of us know what we need to do. A lot of us don't. And a lot of us just need to create the life and the mindset that gets us to where we need to go. And a lot of that comes from our daily habits. It's, you know, you are what you repeatedly do, not what you think, not what you want to do, not what you think you can do. You are just what you do. So in doing little habits throughout the day that you know are making you better, it makes everything in your life easier. And the rest just kind of comes from that. And it's so important. And even myself recently, cuz I know this is coming and I know there's a structure and a plan and a transformation and a challenge, I created myself a diet plan. And in following that, I just immediately felt better. And in doing that, I like trying to be off my phone less in certain times of the day when I'm not working, trying to be more intentional with my family, trying to read more instead of [ __ ] scrolling my phone. I cleaned up my closet randomly, which made me feel way better because I'm decluttering my space and my mind is less anxious. So, all these little changes and habits that people probably don't realize are so important to how you feel. And also probably some of the reasons that you're self-sabotaging other areas of your life are so crucial and so important. And that's why this challenge is more so about changing your body, but really just like getting you into a mindset and a rhythm of life that is making you into the man or woman you want to be and getting you the life that you want. So that's the goal of this challenge. And of course the cash prizes are also dope. But the community that you guys are going to get from this is awesome. Everyone who joins these every year are just so incredible. People have done some crazy transformations in the past. We have some of the examples up on the website, but I'm going to put the link in the comments in the caption here wherever you guys need to find it. If you guys want to sign up, please jump into this and hopefully we can all get shredded or jacked or whatever your goals are. The goal isn't necessarily just get shredded. It could be get jacked. It's just overall transformation creating the best life that you can. And we're going to give you guys the habits, the PDFs, the calls, all the stuff you guys need to succeed. So, yeah, it'll be good. And I need this for myself genuinely. I truly believe having like a end goal and a purpose and a passion and a schedule, routine, structure, all\nthose [ __ ] adjective that you can throw in there really help you actually do the things that you set your mind to. So, super important to do this kind of [ __ ] If not, don't give a [ __ ] You're missing out and you're going to be skinny or not hitting your goals, whatever it may be. But yeah, so that's it. It's a wrap on today's video. Kind of bouncing around today. I still haven't showered. It's the gym and I usually shower at work after I train. So, I'm gonna go inside my home, eat some food, shower, and hang this up for the day. So see you guys"

Narrative order preserved.\nAll right. So, Sunday is fun day. Get to take the fun car out. We get waffles. We get bubbles. And we get fired up for a workout. I don't know how to put this camera in the car, but if you're ever tired on your way to the gym, that's one way to jack up your adrenaline. What is this? You're looking quite crazy, but you're so cute. Peekaboo. What is this? All right, so Saturday morning, Courtney made waffles. So, we're living life right now. Salt and butter, of course, cuz Courtney's buddy the elf. But I'm training up her body today. Been on for a while. Had a shake. Been a minute. So I'm putting some carbs in my body. See if I can go get a nice pump between arms, chest, back today. So going be a beautiful day. Bodybuilding style training. She's going to get a coffee this morning with Replenish. Loading up on sodium as well. And then I'm going to take just pump. No caffeine pre-workout. and then head to the gym and have fun. So, should I bring her in there with me? Yeah. Bradley's wearing her winter hat. She likes hats now. Know what you're gonna do. [Music] Oh, I'll take it today. All right. So, we're in the infamous supplement pantry. Got all the good stuff up here. Special mushrooms to get me super locked in. Those are for earlier in the morning, though. Oh, no. Don't put your hand in there. There's no caffeine. But you can have some pump. Is she going to have pump? Why not? Good for her blood flow. Oh yeah. So we grow big and strong. Let's get that out of there. All right. So waffles, shake earlier, couple eggs, a coffee, scoop a pump, and I don't know. We're ready to rock. So I'll see you guys at the gym. Say bye. Bye. Say byebye. Bye. Are you being shy, girl? Is it time for a nap? Oh. Oh. Oh. Ah. Creedier. [Music] All right. So, the weekends are for fun. I get bubbles in the morning, coffee, and waffles for lunch, and then a quick rip to the gym to get the blood flowing. Jeez. Heat. All right. So, training now, this period at least is a little bit more hypertrophy based, which is very exciting for me. I'm still not like obliterating a muscle, but within the week, I'm getting enough stimulus to grow right now, which is beautiful. And I'm taking a phase out of all the isometric hold stuff for like a week or two at least because it was honestly driving me insane. I just wanted to get in the gym and lift some weights. Been like 6 months of rehab and I was like I need a break. I can finally lift some. So let's do it. So pushing it a little bit, see what my body can handle. Starting off with rotator cuffs and bent over neutral grip cable lateral raise. Always a mouthful. Little rear delts. warm up the shoulders. Then I'm going to do a decline press, which is like a true test of how my shoulder is. So that'll still be light controlling it as I can cable pull down and move on to that right now and really just test how it goes. Pretty crazy. When I started this rehab, I was holding a fat grip. I wasn't even holding a fat grip. I progressed to a fat grip with no weight in it where I was just like lying on my side trying to like get a little bit of range of motion. And now I'm using a 20 pound dumbbell doing external rotator cuff. So we're rocking and rolling. We're getting there for sure. There's still a bunch of movements, like a lateral raise and still some pressing and a pec fly. Still super iffy on my shoulder, but we're getting there. Progress is progress. Hot as hell today cuz it's midday and I normally shoot in the morning, but I'm getting after it. So, hopefully get a nice pump today. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. If anyone has a better method of handing the weights to yourself when you're by yourself doing decline dumbbell, Please let me know because 60 lbs is easy to pick up like that relatively, but I get stronger. I have no idea how to do that by myself. Feel like grabbing a weight like if I have 100 lbs of plus pulling over my head like that with one arm a little bit sketchy. So, taking tips, but two exercises focusing on a controlled negative, especially on the press here at decline, trying to keep my scapulas retracted, elbows in. I'm horrible at that. I naturally always go like this. So, I'm probably still [beep] it up here. See him in the video. Elbows in, scapula retracted. Just really controlling the weight, keeping the tension where it needs to be. Not stressing my shoulder rotator cuff or anything like that. So, feels pretty good. Might bump the weight up a little bit, but perfecting form right now. It's my first time doing decline in a long time. [Applause] Heat. [Applause] Heat. [Applause] Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. All right, the wrap on today's workout. Nice little bicep pump, arm pump there at the end of that. Feeling good. We're progressing. in Arizona\nthis week. Gonna go train with Justin, film some stuff for the app. We got a lot of cool stuff coming up for the app. A lot of crazy [beep] changing in the next couple months in general with all the businesses. So, super excited. Lots of life changes actually coming. I'll keep you guys posted. But for now, we're just trying to get jacked. I got a Sad I got a weekend phone call today. Going home. Going to try on my suit for the wedding. Eat some good food. Call it a day. So, I got to get the hell out of here. wrap this up over the office for a little bit and then maybe still some protein or some aminos. Try and find some carbs somewhere as well. Just looking for snacks everywhere I go essentially. So yeah, that's a wrap on this workout. Thank you guys for watching. See you guys later. All right, so this is something I'm not going to dive deep into what I'm doing, but I want to take you guys along the process of something we're doing for Rod. Something I've wanted to do for a very long time. To start it off, I will show you by example some of our products. And you look at them through average black. It's still the same label but completely black. We have secret stuff which was supposed to be in LTO limited time offer that ended up staying around forever. We have kind of the staple logo raw like that. We have so many labels that are all over the place because we grew so fast with a brand and we were essentially like a teenager trying on new clothes like this looks good, this looks good, let's try this, let's try that. And our business was growing so fast, we didn't have time to like scale back and take a look at the visuals and branding and labeling and like fine-tune it into like a perfect cohesive plan where when you looked at our brand on a shelf, like even when you look at this shelf, it looks like it could be four different brands on there. And now that we're in like a bunch of retailers with a lot of products in GNC, we're getting our own wall. In Vitam Shop, we have our own whole like section in our hometown store. we have wealth in other places and it doesn't like pop out very well because it looks like they're all different brands. So, I've been pushing really hard for us to be able to bring in a really high level creative agency to help us fine-tune our labels, our branding, our mission, our statement, our tone, our identity, everything. So, it's super concrete. Especially now that like we're getting new employees, bring on new people and scaling at such a fast rate. I think it's so important for us to take a step back and really fine-tune like what our purpose is here, what our mission is, what we stand for, what our goal is, and how we look and how we do it, how we act, all those kind of things as if you're a person. So that when people come on, they can understand our brand and they can transmit our brand to the world, whether it's a graphic designer, a content creator, or anything like that. You see a video, you see a graphic, you see an email, SMS blast, you see on shelf somewhere, a promo, a billboard, you know it's raw because it all looks so similar. So, I've been getting on these phone calls with this agency to do this and I'm getting so excited for it cuz they're coming up with some of the coolest work ever. And we're not branching away from what RAW is. If anything, we're taking the best parts of RAW and we're just capitalizing on that. So, instead of us being like a like a what are we like bodybuilders, it's not it's more like who are we? How do we do it? You know, we we support people who like train hard, who lift hard, who get after in the gym, who are their raw authenticelves. No [beep] You're constantly in this endless pursuit of being better and better. There's not a destination you're chasing after. You're just on this mission to be the best version of yourself. And you're putting in the work to do that. And RAW give you the raw materials, the building blocks you need to be able to level yourself up. The inspiration, the supplements, everything that you guys need to be the best versions of yourself. We want our content to display that. We want when you look at our packaging for you to feel that, for you to understand that our merch when we come out, we got some new better merch coming out daily, weekly, monthly, whatever the [beep] it is. But we're fine-tuning all that to look so much better. I think it's so important as the brand is growing to be able to have that like strict identity so that people just know who you are in an instant. You know, if you see if you're scrolling through Instagram, you're like, \"All right, I know that's a raw video.\" Because they have such a consistent\ntheme of how they display themselves. Same with labels on shelves. So, very complicated because we have like a wide variety of supplements, you know, like started with raw pre, which was like 50 milligs of caffeine, super simple. And then was like our heavy hitter pre-workout. And then we wanted to make a really [beep] good pre-workout that was in competition with some other big ones. And we wanted to make a similar price comparison but a much better product to that which is where the essential line came out. So we have essential, we have favage, we have superavage, we have grass-fed isolate, we have seabbum difference still isolate protein. So how do we differentiate it on shelf so that you guys can see and understand what you're getting? I personally really want to grow our online sales. I want to grow our athletes, which we're signing a bunch of really good actually competitors this year, which I'm fired up about. So, bigger athletes, chasing after a lot of people, and that's to grow our online sales. And then we have GNC and Vitamin Shop, which is like the heart and soul of retail, of like true training. And then there's like FDM, the food drug mass of like the Kroger, the Publix, the Walmart, the Sam's Club, all those different things. So, understanding what products go where, depending on how they look, the cost, affordability, the type of consumer in that place who's going to be buying that. Sam's Club isn't going to be buying a $55 pre-workout for that. They're more likely to have essential pre-workout, which is bulk, affordable, it works [beep] good, and it tastes incredible. Vitamin Shop, GNC specifically, sells a lot of really high stem pre-workout. So, our Superthavage is in there. We give them exclusive flavors and it does incredible in there because people love blowing their face off with this [beep] and it's a absolutely insane pre-workout. So, this is something I'm actually really excited about with the project I've been taking on personally for this brand and it's going to be [beep] cool. You guys are gonna be fired up with what RAW is going to do this year for sure. We have some sick announcements at the Olympia, some big names. We're bringing on some new labels, new packaging, some cool [beep] And I'm just excited to get back to what I believe RAW is. Just that idea of like the whole champion mentality, having no quit, being the best version of yourself, being raw and authentic, unapologetically yourself. So, we're going to be building that once it comes closer and I can actually share stuff. I'm going to show you guys some of the stuff, but I just wanted to not [beep] on our brand because I'm super proud of everything that we've done. Extremely proud of what we've done. I just think what we've slacked on is creating a cohesive brand that makes sense and looks similar across the board. So, that's what we're working on now. And I think the best way to describe it is like we grew so fast. It's literally like a teenager. You're goth when you're a skater when you're you're [beep] wearing Hollister and preppy when you're you're kind of figuring out your style. And then when you get into your late 20s, 30s, whatever it may be, you're like, \"Okay, this is who I am. I don't give a [beep] what anyone else says. I don't care if this sells better. I don't care if this gets more views. This is who I am, and I'm going to stick to that regardless of anything. We're not going to hop on trends. We're not going to do any of that [beep] We're going to stay true to who we are.\" And that's the best way I can put that. And that's what I want more than anything for RAW. As we scale as much as possible, I want to maintain those roots of who we are in the bodybuilding community. People who train hard, get after it. Whether you're a [beep] mom who's up all night with her baby and has to go to work and still [beep] kill it. You're [beep] working your 9 to5 exhausted. Go do whatever. You're going to get in the gym. You're going to kick some ass. Big ramble, but I'm excited about this. So, going to be working on this. Stay tuned. them cause you to come."

Narrative order preserved. \nwhat is up youtube today is leg day so it's gonna be a full workout vlog the last few ones you guys were like there's not enough training there's no workout in the sandwich video so today full leg workout i'm gonna try and squat today because i'm trying to not be a [beep] get huge legs again we have mr grant behind the camera you guys may know him from ann's vlogs so he's taking over today so i can get some footage up before i travel this weekend because i'm going to aspen for a week dom is down there right now me and jansen are going we're going to be snowboarding and ripping the hills so hopefully i can get some footage of that but we don't have a grant or calvin or scott coming so probably not a whole lot but for now it's telling huge likes like i said last week i swatted the first time i'd squatted in six months maybe it had been a while but i still was hack squatting and all that jazz so i still had some decent strengths in me but i'm going to be trying to keep those in my routine for a while now at least until i'm dead lifting or doing something every week but we're gonna get in there try and beat whatever i did last week which i think was four plates for 11 reps so i got to get 12 reps and that's the day so in the change drinking a pre-workout get over there get after it all right here we are revive gym leg day still trying to muster up the energy the life inside of me bringing it out of myself because i got a squat i gotta warm up i got some old man knees i got older man hips but we're gonna make will work i haven't even seen this but heads up what you haven't seen it yourself i haven't seen it on myself i just put it on we just had these printed today freshly off the press drop in first week of february we did a whole redesign of savage so hopefully you guys liked it you like the old one but now you can still rock the savage teeth it's a different design i don't know i think it's sick it reminds me of like old school like skater vibes or something this is the skater boy see you later boy look up a good leg there old man knees i got some serious old man knees ever since i took time off training it honestly got worse rest does not help your joints just make you tighten up even more so i need a lot of warm up on my quads hamstrings everything and then we're gonna get in the back little dungeon and get under the squat bar ew i'm worse i get it worse i'm his brother i guess we're not warming up my hamstrings just go outside and clean it up very nicely [Music] yeah i cleaned up your nasty flash off that thing i was trying to use it i'm just coming for my hair you're filthy so laid back [Music] it looks a little better [Music] i don't get pumps anymore it just burns which kind of feels good i guess i just cleaned that you put your crotch right where my face goes if you crouch and said ass when this time wow i guess i'm not doing hamstrings today see other people put their faces there too you know the whole gym is just watching and disgust hopefully we lose some membership and it won't be as busy sorry dom but too busy this machine's a little bit too light the full stack so instead of just doing like 20 reps i do 20 reps and then i go back to like i started with go to failure and i do it twice so do like three sets in one not a drop set but like a rest pause the rest is like whatever however long the other leg takes yeah it doesn't feel great no it feels great but it does now you get to put your face where ian just had his i'm not using that machine wait till they're done\nthis guy not the nice guy you think he is oh that's almost worse to lay on at least it's not your ass do you want to give that a couple are you gonna sit on it now oh not on the new t-shirt that looks like i'm sweating that looks like i'm working they ended up pretending to sweat well it's just really wet ever since i tore my right hamstring it hurts and it cramps a lot but it like built my mind muscle \nconnection for some reason i felt the tear i felt the muscle and it somehow translated to the other leg when i trained hamstrings now they contract so hard it's like they're cramping so pro tip don't try this at home tear your hamstring if you can't feel them it works time to enter the the dungeon layer see if these knees and hips can handle some squats today so i have some good news actually i didn't share this yet yesterday me and courtney went to a surgeon to see if i needed hernia surgery and the good news is he said i don't my hernia is like really small right now it's in my belly button which has a natural hole already so he said he would have honestly had to make the hole bigger close it fully so he's like you don't need it right now if it gets worse it'll get worse but surgery wouldn't help it it would have gotten worse anyways so good news no no i almost did no shoulder surgery that's like foreshadowing in the future no knock on wood my shoulder's still [beep] up but the hernia doesn't need surgery so one surgery avoided it's been a while since you squat when it actually hurts your traps to put it on i'm not gonna use the pad i will not use the pad so i'm not gonna kind of hurt my traps a bit it's right there that's a thick pad too yeah the big girl didn't happen only off camera do i use that it keeps me humble two times two times oh it's not updated i haven't updated one but it's on the wall i got two of these so again it's the memories you know oh yeah remember where you started hmm i felt like what four place felt like last week there we go put the wd-40 on the knees you're all good they're extra loose though so they don't actually help me that much too easily i get them on yeah just to keep you a little warm okay people do always ask me though when to wear sleeves why wear new sleeves personally i'm old i have old man knees so i just wear them for injury prevention when i go heavy but i personally like to warm up like you saw here up until one or two sets before my working set i'll wear no sleeves and that's just so i'm not completely dependent on them i still got a little bit of completely free like weight on my knee and then when i start to go heavier especially now that i'm getting back into squats i throw the sleeves on and i wear really loose ones more just to keep my knee a little supportive and warm so i don't [beep] it up so injury prevention always important i put too much pressure on myself to hit well pressure is a privilege people always ask so hmm uh i lost track 14. oh i think i definitely did it 14. i lost track i was either out of it or was it jesus definitely the song choice huh you can't go wrong with some priestess i can't even talk 160 oh my god that's my fan rep 4 my heart rate's just like spiking just keep going don't stop that's like for me the biggest thing my heart rate shoots up when i trade unless i'm like what's that quite in shape yeah like in all season shape it's still my muscular endurance being able to push so my heart rate going that high because now i'm [beep] fried right now whereas normally i would be able to do that keep my heart rate like just over 100. what the but not right we still did it all right so my method right now of training is i murder myself for one set and the second set is i try and do the same way some sort of uh deload if you will and just because my body still isn't used to like a lot of stress or stimulus this is just my like third leg workout back where i'm actually training properly like this but like third good one so instead of completely frying my system i'm trying to get the most out of the least so my body's still going to be growing because it's more stress than i'm used to and i'm not kind of hurting myself in the process so hopefully i'll get like 8 to 10 on this one and then go do something shitty like bulgarian split squats or something uh foreign [Music] pushing nearly as hard but my head is still spinning what's that heart rate at it fire that's why i gotta practice my meditation i don't know i've been calling bulgarians but squats dreaded but i don't even hate them that much i just feel like social media has like a stigma of hating them but they're really not that bad and they're great for building outer quad glute combo like my glutes get fired on these that's how you build that like big\nback shot with like tight glute creations that'll build that booty [Applause] that's the first time i picked the dumbbell up over 100 pounds in a while watch your toes yeah it's dangerous i need steel-toed socks let's go to the gym [Music] that just burned through the whole leg and there's still another one to go i guess this is why people hate bulgarians eh yeah because you die after one and then you still have to do it again you're too lazy to even stand up just fall back into the chair gas starts to drink burn on empty you run it on empty i need an e85 tune i fill up oh the heat of the moment drops it just felt right uh [Music] right back down still a lot of volume for me right now so pretty much that's a wrap on this like i keep reiterating as i'm like re constituting re adding what am i looking for whatever putting back in training intensity keeping my set volume low so i'm only doing two working sets right now reintegrate it's a good word grant needs to stick around more reintegrate i'm putting in less set volume so i'm only doing two working sets thrown on a drop set if i feel like i could do more move on to the next exercise caller today so we're gonna do hamstring girls now plus calves we're done moving on to my favorite hamstring curl machine that has ever been created the pre-core p-r-e-c-o-r if you're a gym owner please buy one because if i visit i would love to use it but this is the holy grail of hamstring machine so currently i'm doing like a bro split so you guys know what that is trading one body part a day cycling seven day split two days off but normally i do hamstrings and a leg day and i can't even explain what i normally do but i'm gonna switch back to that soon just i was getting back into training i did grossly so right now i'm doing calves once a week but normally i do it twice when i have two like this but still i like to alternate the standing calf raise i'm losing my mind right now and the seated cap rate alternating weeks i don't do them in the same workout i'll just destroy it for like four to six sets and then do the other one the next week and i finally get to a good balance in my category so i don't know anecdotal evidence that it worked [Music] [Music] is [Music] hmm so that would burn the hamstrings [Applause] triple double double drop [Music] hey scott i'm on the show for today are you yep maddie with our chauffeur here he's just bombing rides yeah pun intended got him my car's ready already but so it was like in idle it was like the engine was like revving even on idle so that he had to like adjust some [beep] he thought i had a vacuum leak but but now it's in west palm but i don't want to go to the [beep] west palm so i think i'm trying to leave it there until i get back from because i'm on the way home that's responsible just it's in a side street back a little area you know yeah some photographer is going to find it yeah in that shop there are two r34s so if someone's stealing something they're not going to take mine i realize i've never i never speak about my beloved gtr you know people know i have it and they love it but i just got it down here in florida and it was a shop that works especially with jdm cars so i brought it to them and they did a tune on it did an e85 tune i have a flex fuel kit injectors i have already have the full cat-back exhaust downpipes and everything so it's pushing pretty good right now i i told him to dyno it right now because he was fixing the tune i don't know if he did the guy's kind of he's really smart but he's a little doesn't speak english that well sometimes so either way the car is really fast i think i'm gonna have to find like an empty plot of land or something and just go [beep] rip it for a video because it's pretty fun to drive right now okay [Music] i don't understand that training cabs isn't like as genetic as people think everyone just does it at the end of their workout and they do like oh i'm gonna finish legs with some little bit of calves you know you actually have to train calf like you're squatting or [beep] quad extensions should be the same intensity and 99 of the time your cows will grow may not be huge but they'll grow all right kiddos the wrap on today's workout that's the first full real leg day i've posted on youtube in a long time this is like the foreshadowing message symbolism whatever you might want to call it then i'm finally getting back on my [beep] legs are going up getting stronger squatting every week what's the other thing i've been doing barbell rowing i want to start dead lifting getting back into all the [beep] trying a huge trinket strong chase after the fourth olympia title i think i have 11 months to go right now so still gonna be one of the\nlongest offseasons i have but that just means time to make the most improvements i've ever made so i'm gonna get home probably eat some pasta right now because i'm starving late then head to aspen this weekend so hopefully i can get some footage down there hit rip in the hill if not then uh the thing with snowboarding and filming that i need someone as good as me to film following which normally you don't have you're a good snowboarder yeah i'm okay i can tread down a black diamond i can't do like back flips and [beep] okay so i'm close so we're gonna have fun this week come back lock it down and get back to work so

    "text": "Cutting ? Video Transcript \nSource: User-provided transcript \nPrepared on 2025-10-26 \nNotes \nThis is a cleaned, formatted transcript based on your text. Short, title-like lines were treated as section headers (e.g., ?How Do I Start a Cut??).\nIntro \n[Music] What is up, YouTube? I was going to do a full day of eating today, which will come soon, but I remembered when I did that ultimate guide to bulking, a lot of people requested the ultimate guide to cutting. So, I'm going to be doing that instead. Still making a meal right now, eating clean, but I'm going to be running you guys through just some tips and tricks that I learned on the long along the way of my bodybuilding career on how to get shredded. It's also because I'm kind of going into like a mini cut of myself, at least trying to lean up while maintain muscle, not a hard tread. But I'll be talking about what I do, but mainly about a lot of questions that I get about it. Similar \nHow Do I Know When to Cut? \nto the bulking one, it started off with how do I know when to cut and how long do I cut for? And again, it's very dependent on what your goals are. But in my opinion, when you start to lose your abs, for me especially, cuz my abs are something that are gone pretty late. So when I have a lot of body fat, I'll lose them. But if you have no ab showing anymore, you might be at the point of a bulk where you're starting to lose and plateau and you need to cut down, you know, fix your insulin sensitivity, your metabolism, your digestion, a lot of things that are better off in a cut. So, when you get to that point where you don't really like how your body looks, you're kind of fatter than you want to be, or you just want to be leaner cuz it's personal preference, then you can start a cut. And cuts can really go as long as you want, depending on how you do it. If it's like a really punch in the face shred and you're like 2% body fat, that's aggressive. sub 10% body fat over an extended period of time, it will start to affect your hormones. So, you don't really want to do that for longer than like, you know, probably 3 to four months. But if you're just like getting shredded, coming back up a little bit, having reheats, consistently fueling your body, and you're continuously making progress in the gym, you can keep going constantly. As long as your body feels good, your body's optimized, energy is good, still making progress, you can keep pushing and going, going. So, don't stress about going too long, unless you're like sacrificing in the gym and you're starting to lose all your gains. \nHow Do I Start a Cut? \nAll right, so the next big thing is how do you start a cut? And in my opinion, there's a lot of ways to do it, but there's two main ways to do it, and it depends on your lifestyle, so I'll go over both. The best way to do it, in my opinion, is you're already eating relatively consistently. Even if you're not tracking, but you think you eat the same thing every day. Log every single thing that you eat for at least a week. 2 weeks is even better. But if you log everything you put in your mouth like condiments, juices, drinks on top of all your food, vegetables, everything, count the calories every single day and track your weight and night and do that for an extended period of time. Most people naturally get to a baseline where they're eating about the same and they're staying about the same weight when they're not trying. And that's your baseline calories. So from there, you need to adjust up or down on where to start. The other way is if you're super inconsistent, you have no idea what you're eating. Sometimes you're up, sometimes you're down, and you don't know where you're going. You can start with a macro calculator. Enter in all your all your information. It will tell you where to start. Give you a rough estimate. But still start with that. Follow it every single day for a couple weeks and track consistently and see what your weight does. If you're gaining too fast or losing too fast or whatever it may be, then you really want to adjust that from the point of picking\nBalancing Macros \nout your macros. Cuz this is personally how I like to diet. I would pick macros and then create a diet plan off that and then stick to that strict diet plan. Macros are super basic. Everyone know this. It's going to be 1 to 1.5 grams per pound of lean body mass of protein that you want to hit. So if I'm 260 pounds in my offseason, but my lean body mass is 240, then I want to be a minimum of 240 g of protein. But I almost always pump that up to like 350 because there's a lot of studies that have shown that if you're hitting up to 100 grams of protein per meal multiple times in a day, you can still use that and increase protein density more and more and more and keep making more gains. And especially in a cut when you're trying to preserve muscle as much as possible, having enough protein is extremely crucial. Even your body's ability to metabolize protein requires more energy and it's less likely to turn protein into fat than it is carbs into fat. Some more protein is a great thing on a cut. Don't be scared of it. Start with that. And then from there, picking your carbs and fats. It's dependent on the individual. I like to do 7030 splits to start. So, I do 70% carbs, 30% fat. And because I have a higher ratio of carbs, as I'm dieting, I'm kind of pulling from that. But it's super simple. You start with that. You find what your baseline is by tracking over an extended period of time. Log your food, log your weight, see what you're at. Biggest tip. Um, I could probably leave 90% of the world. Yeah, they're probably not 90% of the world cuz if you're watching my YouTube channel, you probably care about your fitness. You're more into it. But the average person can just track their weight, write down what they're putting. And that psychological conscious awareness of what they're eating would change their habits of what they're eating. They're like, \"Holy [beep] I'm eating 100 g of sugar from this coke and this [beep] and all that [beep] I'm just I don't want to write that down. I'm not going to eat it.\" And it will make you better. And even myself at the level that I am, that still makes me better to an extent. But when we want to be elite and make gains, you have to go beyond that. So track everything consistently going forward. And once you have that, you have your baseline calories. So your weight's not changing. You have enough protein so that you can recover, make gains, keep your muscle, and you're at a consistent thing. I like to drop two to 300 calories to start and add in a little bit of cardio, not cardio to the point where you're going crazy or not. And I'll get into cardio a little bit later, but the key thing is just drop 200 calories. Personally, I start purely from carbs. So, I have my baseline 1.5 g per pound of body weight of protein, 70% carbs for the rest of my macros, 30% fat, and then I take 200 calories of carbs, and I pull that out of my diet. And then that's how I start, and I know I'm good to go. [Music] Creating a Diet Plan All right, so next thing is that there's two ways, again, two optimal ways, in my opinion, is more to it of creating a diet. There's if it fits your macros. But if it's fit your macros, whole foods, which I recommend way more than if it fits your macros, shitty food. Get into that, too. And then there's just a meal plan. I personally like having a meal plan cuz it just takes the guesswork out of everything. The more you have to consciously think and you get decision fatigue and you go overinking, you're more likely to make bad decisions because naturally we go to the easy decision and we're constantly over and overthink. We're going to pick the easy thing, which is usually better food, more access or something. So, in my mind, having the same thing I'm eating every single day, it just doesn't even have an option to cheat on my meal to cheat on my meal plan. So, I literally write it out and I print it cuz I'm [beep] old like that. If I had a fridge that had a magnet on it, I would put it right on there. But, I write this out. Meal 1 2 3 4 5 plus a shake. And I write it out and I eat the same thing every single day. And then from there, it's easy to break. And if I want on a day, it's like, okay, my breakfast is two eggs, one scoop of isolate, 40 g of oats. I'm rushing out the door. I know 40 g of oats is 27 g of carbs. I have two pieces of toast that are each 15 grams of carbs. I'll survive that day, you know, but typically trying to hit that. The other style, obviously, if it fits your macros, the idea of that one is that you have, my opinion, it\nmeans you have a lot more time on your hands and you're a person who craves foods really heavily. So, the idea is understanding what's going to work best for you. Whatever plan that you can adhere to most consistently will be the best route. Not necessarily saying a diet plan or macros are the better way to do it, but if you're going to do one more consistently, then it's much better. But when it comes to the macros, like I said, whole foods are so much more important. Again, if I were to talk to the average population, I'd be like, track your food, eat whole foods. Just start with fat and most people will be so much healthier and in much better shape. And it's a lot harder to over consume in healthy foods. Like eating ultrarocessed foods, you're just more likely to condense calories in. And on top of that, there's a bigger cascade effect. I'm not a big believer in the whole calories in calories out being everything because there's a hormonal effect that you have of putting foods in your body. There's higher inflammation, higher cortisol, eating at certain times a day, eating shitty foods. It can affect your sleep when you sleep soft. Again, higher cortisol. Higher cortisol mean it's hard harder for your body to burn fat. So, you're not going to get lean as fast. And it could have all these other effects on top of affecting your energy while you train your ability to recover. And obviously, more muscle you have, the more fat you can burn, the more muscle you want to have, more shredded you look. There's so many effects to it. So, I don't even want to talk about if it fits your macro shitty food. I don't recommend at all. Clean bulks, clean cuts, all the way. Healthy food is the way to go. We're taking care of our bodies. Just eat healthy. But if you have the time to go through every single meal and be like, \"Okay, I'm going to have 50 g of protein, 10 g of fat, 30 g of carbs. I can eat whatever I want in the realm of potato, rice, chicken, salmon, almond butter, all the different arrays of healthy whole foods, then good for you. But I don't have [beep] time for that [beep] So, I eat the same thing every single day, and I know what I got to do. And if dinner is something my family's making, then I can weigh it out and figure it out from there. [Music] \nCheat Meals \nAll right, so on the topic of kind of shitty foods like and if it fits your macros, people love to ask about cheat meals. And in my opinion, it depends on the person. If you're trying to drive results is your biggest goal and that's all you care about, then no, you shouldn't be having cheat meals. A cheat meal of shitty food is strictly for the mental reprieve that you need it. So, if you eat [beep] a burger on Sunday and you can continuously lose weight doing that and mentally you feel better and it drives you through the week excited for that, then fine. We all have our reasons to push forward and continue. But if you're optimally trying to progress, then no, cheat meals are not good. I really never had cheat meals throughout my preps unless I like needed to hammer in like a burger and fries cuz I couldn't get enough calories in. 99% of the time it was a refeed day. out with exactly the same foods I'm eating consistently, but instead of 100 g of rice in a meal, it would be like 300 g of rice and an avocado. So, getting that clean food and doing it and just kind of giving my metabolism a kick in the ass, driving the workout the next day. And \nTraining & Nutrient Timing \nagain, I spoke about this a lot in prep, but those would be typically pushed right before a leg day. So, if I had like a heavy workout chest day, the next day was leg day, I'd have the cheat meal that night to recover from that chest day and then drive those carbs into the leg day the next day. So, I'm getting recovery and performance from the benefit. Super important. So, metabolism \nRamping Your Metabolism\nis obviously a big talk when it comes to dieting. And there's like the idea of ramping up your metabolism and also the idea of it slowing down over time. And there's also a lot of debate of whether or not this is true and what causes it. But from my personal experience, which contradicts some studies, but it's worked for me, so I don't really care. If I can ramp up my metabolism before I'm dieting for eating more meals in a day and more food in a day consistently and utilize that food by training maybe a little bit of cardio in my offseason, then when I started prep eating more calories, I'm in a much better position. I've started preps eating 6,000 calories a day and my diet just like coasts through. And I've started preps at like 3,000 calories a day where I need to almost ramp up a bit and then back down and they're much harder. But I've always noticed that throughout my offseason, I get a little bit lazy and I'll eat three meals a day and I'll start to feel sluggish, harder to eat, all these things. And if I cut those meals into smaller meals and I spread them out throughout the day, I'm eating the same amount of food and also my energy will get better, my digestion will get better. I'll start to get leaner while eating the same amount of food. So, I can up my calories. I'm able to obviously consume more energy. Therefore, I'll recover better, train better, and make more gains. And there's a lot of people, everyone scientifically believes that you can't boost your metabolism by eating more frequent meals and spreading them out. So, I don't know, but for me, it has worked every single time. And I've done it in a vacuum. Not many people have been like, I eat the same thing, taking the same supplements that did not change, the same thing consistently, the same cardio, waking up at the same time, eating the same thing. All I did was divide from five to six meals, and I got a little bit leaner from there. And then I went from six to seven meals at the end of my Olympia prep, and it was super helpful for me. So stuff like intermittent fasting can help because it's easy to just not eat and then cram food at the end of the day. But in my opinion, you're going to blunt your metabolism over time to do that and plateau a lot quicker. So not something I recommend. All right, so another \nHow Fast Should I Lose Weight? \nquestion consistently get is how fast should you lose weight and how do you know if you're losing it too fast? And in my opinion, the big best way to avoid that is not by throwing too many tools in at once. So, like I said at the beginning, by just starting with a little bit of cardio and then taking down \n200 calories from your baseline, you're not just going to plummet from doing something such a small change. But if you're like, I'm going to do an hour cardio. I'm going to cut 1,000 calories. I'm going to start doing X, Y, and Z. I'm going to walk every do all these different things and your body starts dropping too fast, then you're much likely to plateau. So, if you're trying to do a long cut, let your body have the tools over time. Start with small things at a time. But on average, I would say if you're losing more than like three pounds a month, you're close to that point. Through my Olympia preps, I would lose I would start relatively lean, but to get like peeled, I would lose 25 lbs over 14 weeks. So that's less than 2 lbs a week on average. But typically, I'd get down to like 250 lbs and then be like 4 weeks out still and I would lose 10 lbs in the last 4 weeks. So there's a way that you can do it up and down. But another big thing on that is if you start hitting plateaus too early when their standard plus group, this is the biggest thing that I've learned from talking to all these people will be like, \"Hey, I'm plateaued. I can't lose any more weight. I'm 220 lb eating a 1,400 calories doing this.\" And I'm like, \"Wa, that's like a low amount of calories for that weight to not be losing any weight.\" So, your body probably starts it needs to ramp up a little bit. And if you're trying to get lean and that's all you care about, let's say you're prep in a transformation challenge or whatever it may be, in my opinion, the best thing that you can do is start carb cycling. And this is like an elite level of dieting. Cutting your calories is one thing, but being able to carb cycle is super effective. So, if you can start having those refeed days, like I said, a high carb day before a heavy workout.\nYou're kind of boosting your body's metabolism. You're letting it know you're going to be giving it fuel. You're going to be giving it something that it needs so it can like work extra hard on those days. train hard, get the system running, and then the next day when you cut back down to low calories, it will like fall through that cell. And it just gives your body the signal that you're not in starvation mode all the time cuz your body's constantly starving. It's just preserving energy and trying to hold on to the best possible. So that's one of the best ways to do it. The other way would just to be pull off your diet for a little bit, up your calories by like 200. So the reverse of how you started, and start ramping up a little bit rather than down, and let your body get used to properly be properly recovering and all these things. There's so many other factors that come into that that I could ramble on forever, but the biggest one I would say is sleep. If you're high cortisol and your sleep is [beep] and you're trying to diet, it's going to stop you from doing it. So sometimes dieting too hard makes you lose sleep. So you need that little bit of recmp where you're eating a little bit more. Maybe you're taking a little bit off training. You're recovering. Your nervous system is recovering. You're sleeping better. You're dropping your cortisol for an extended period of time. And then you hop back in your diet and you'll continue to progress. So don't stress about it. If you're like, I'm eating 1400 calories and I'm not losing weight. I need to go down 1,000 calories. Maybe your body needs a break. But really, really listen to yourself and you have to be tracking consistently to actually know these things. All right, so meals sometimes suck in \nBest Condiments \ndieting. And the topline answer is it is what it is. You're trying to get shredded. Take it. But for people who are just dieting for life or even myself sometimes being able to just optimize condiments to make food taste a little bit better, the three top condiments that I used throughout my preps were honey mustard, Sriracha, and coconut aminos. Cocon probably had the most sugar. I specifically got the whole foods honey mustard because it was the lowest amount of sugar, lowest amount of calories. And in Sriracha, you have to be careful for some of them. They have sugar in them, but those are super low calorie and good to go. But the goal with condiments is if you start your prep with them, keep them in until you have to cut them out. But if you don't have any condiments in and then you add them in later, you're technically adding more calories. So the goal is like if you start consistently with something and you're adjusting changes with everything every other variable being the same variable being the same, then you're good to go to continue to make progress. But you don't want to add in something like honey mustard when you're 2 weeks out the Olympia cuz you're adding in a significant amount of calories relative to what you're eating to not affect it. But food does some suck sometimes. So finding the right amount of condiments to add stuff can be beneficial. But weigh it at least a couple times because you'll be shocked by how much you do it. People who use almond butter are like, \"Yeah, a teaspoon of it.\" They're putting like four tablespoons on it. Or this says five calories per teaspoon. A teaspoon is like absolutely nothing. I would probably put at least four teaspoons minimum on a meal. So, it's 20 calories. So, just be conscious of that. Don't be dumb. What isn't measured, isn't managed. Continue to track your stuff so you actually know what's going in your body and understand why you are or not getting results. Best Supplements for Cutting All right. So, people love to ask about supplements for especially for cutting, putting on muscle or cutting. Cutting, I feel like people just lean into supplements. I never really was big on taking specific supplements that led to fat loss. But in terms of supplements that can help on a cut, first off, I would start with things that are just important in keeping your systems running, whether it be hormone production, energy production, all the different things. So, something like a multivitamin, especially when you're dieting really hard. Hopefully, you're getting your veggies in and all the stuff, but food also\nsucks nowadays. But when you're limiting your food, maybe you're not getting enough nutrients. So something like a multivitamin is super helpful. Beyond that, satiating the body is super important. Protein is huge. So I always have a protein powder in it. It's probably the leanest, easily, easiest digestible, lowest calorie way to get in any amount of protein. The protein shake. Also, in terms of like diet hacks, if you're ever going out to like dinner with people and you're trying to maybe just get a steak and eat food or not eat at all or going out for a long drive or whatever it may be, if you bring a protein shake with you, chug it right before going to dinner, it like kills cravings, kills your hunger super fast when it's only like 140 calories. So, super beneficial to utilize something like that. Amino acids also something really big just in terms of not losing muscle over extended periods of time. Being able to sip on it between meals and spike protein thin more and more time throughout the day to keep yourself progressing I think is super big. On top of that, I would say keeping inflammation low is always important. Same thing as cortisol management, hormone management, just keeping your systems operating. So something like an omega-3, super simple and easy to add in. And then I would say mental things for myself, especially when I'm down to like really dying. You start to be tired and dragging ass and you start to like not be able to remember a lot of things. stuff like alpha GPC, Cognizen, Tyroin to help that dopamine precursor to just keep your body to keep your mind focused and locked in, be able to know what you're doing, especially before the gym, like pre-workouts that have a good amount of caffeine and neutropics in it so that you can focus and get the job done and not just be like tired and lazy and hanging around. Super important. So, in my opinion, I wasn't a big guy taking any fat burners or anything like if I take this, I'll get shredded without doing anything. It was more so optimizing my systems and curbing my hunger, keeping protein sensitive high. I can still not say that word. It'll never come to me. But that was how I viewed supplements in a cut for myself. So give it a shot. Cardio also a huge \nCardio \nquestion people continuously ask about. Similar to what I was talking about not using tools too early, cardio is all about minimum effective dose. So having as minimal as possible when you're trying to maintain as much muscle as possible. And my cardio has changed now that I'm not competing anymore. and I actually care about my cardiovascular health and I want to be able to hit that so it's adjusted. But when I was in prep and I was just trying to get shredded, it was just incline walk on a treadmill. The lowest stress on my body which are where I was burning calories. I was trying to get my heart rate still to like 120 beats per minute. And then the \ndebate is always do you do it at night? \nDo you do the morning fasted? How do you want to do it? And in truth, it really doesn't matter as long as you're getting it done. The only thing is you don't want to do it before a workout because you don't want to take away your energy and nutrients away from driving into putting on muscle because it's still obviously the most important thing. So, I used to like doing it first thing in the morning and then I would eat a couple meals and train later in the day and that was the best way to implement it into my life. Now that I'm retired and life is different, I train after a meal one. So, I don't do cardio in the morning and I'll typically do cardio post-workout. So instead of doing before, which ruins your workout, I get the workout in. Maybe I'll get some aminos and then I'll do some cardio at my gym or or if I'm not at work all day that day, I'll come home and I bought two pieces of cardio that are a little bit more fun than just walking on a treadmill. So, I have a rower that I've been doing for hit training and then I have a bike which I can bike around my neighborhood and sometimes I combine both of them just to get more interest more interesting and I'll do them later\nin the day, do them in the sunlight, get outside, do some things and it kind of gets more active and gets me outside doing things rather than just chilling. I will also say that there's some people who train bodybuilders who get shredded and win shows who don't do any cardio. They just tell them to increase their steps. Start at like 5k steps, 7k steps, go to 10k steps, and just walk more in a day and track that. And those people get shredded, too, and it's possible. Some people get shredded without cardio. It really just depends on your body. So, the goal is if you're not losing weight and you brought your calories down a little bit, then add a little bit of cardio. I would start with 20 minutes five times a week, and just get your body moving, consistently burning a little bit more calories. The more output you have, the more input you can have, the more you can eat, and it's just a better system for your body to run. So, try different things that work best for you. You can do hit cardio, low intensity, steady state cardio, whatever you want to do. But if you're a bodybuilder, an optimalist muscle training, shredded, nothing else, low intensity, steady state is the way to go. Now that I want to have better heart health, better HRV, be in better shape. I've been doing a little bit more hit cardio at times, more biking, more this, more that, and it's super helpful. All Training on a Cut right, so training on a cut. You could get a lot deeper into this, but I'm giving you guys the [beep] top line right now. most important thing that you need. But in my mind, the goal is to not have to change your training until you have to. A lot of people are like, \"Oh, I'm cutting. I'm going to be tired. Let me drop the weight and then do more volume.\" And they do that before they're actually tired. But you don't want to preemptively do that. You want to wait till you're actually to the point where you can't lift a certain weight cuz you're so exhausted that it has to pull down. But if you can keep pushing forward and keep training hard and training intense through a cut and not changing anything, you're going to be better off. You're going to maintain more muscle or even put on muscle throughout that cut. So, I never really had different programs that were like, \"Hey, I'm going to do sets of 20 now that I'm dieting because it burns more calories.\" Because it really the amount of car calories extra that it burns is like negligent and you're just sacrificing gains by not lifting the way that's optimal to maintain and build muscle. So, don't really do it. How do you train like that? You really just don't be a [beep] The longer that you can actually push yourself and just mentally train hard, you're going to be better off for it. So, the thing that you can do in a cut around training that helps it is just nutrient timing. When you're down to really low calories and low carbs, the best way training wise is to put your carbs like moderate before, high after. It's not high, but if you have 50 g of carbs in a day, which is super low, I would do 20 g pre, 30 g post, and split it up like that so that you're getting it around your training, which is the most important time of the day for your body to be able to recover and utilize that as you need it. And that's really the biggest thing that I change around cutting other than just spreading out the carbs throughout the day. The only time that would change is if your sleep is really bad and you're starving in the middle of the night and you can't sleep. You can test this everything at the test in a sample to see what works best for your body by putting some carbs right before bed and seeing if that doesn't create a blood sugar drop, a cortisol spike in the middle of the night, which will ruin your sleep and then again will affect your cortisol, your gains, your fat loss, everything else. But beyond that, keep training hard. Don't change your program unless you have to put carbs around the workout. You're good to go. All right. So, I'll just go through a bunch of like tips and tricks now because a big question is like how do I How to Fight Cravings fight cravings? Essentially, again, topline answer is if you want high results, expect high discomfort. That's just the way it was. The more you suffer, the more you endure, the more results that you'll see. So, that's part of life and it's inevitable. But on top of that, if you're like constantly hungry, having hungry, having crazy cravings, one thing it may be is cortisol. High cortisol leads to a craving for ultrarocessed food, sugar, dense calories, whatever it may be, it makes you want food more. So things like screen exposure, being on your phone too much, having a stressful life situation, poor sleep, all these different things first of all affect each\nother, which then also affects the cascade of your hormones that make you more hungry and constantly wanting things. So just be conscious of that. All right. So huge Create a System for Success thing. I talk about this a lot. Having a structure, having system, setting yourself for up for success. A taking the guesswork out of it. So when you have a conscious brain, when you want the goal and you have good drive, you create a plan and then when your brain is feeling weak and falling off, you just follow the plan and it makes it easier for you. But setting yourself up with something like a system going throughout your day. Let's say I tell you it's perfect to eat your carbs before and after a workout, but in your mind, you train right in the middle of the day, and then when you come home at night, you have these crazy cravings. Well, then maybe it's better for you to drive results for you to have lower carb throughout the day while you're at work, driving the kids to school, doing things, busy, not thinking about it. You keep your calories low as possible, carbs low at that point. And then when you're home at night and you're chilling, you're bored, you're hanging out doing nothing, your cravings start to come. Well, at least you have carbs for that. So, it's kind of called carb backloading than putting it at the end of the day. And just that's more playing a mental game than it is a physical game, which is totally fine. If it drives results, it works. These things are all very nuanced and they're like fractional benefits. Eat at the right time and do all the things. When you stack these things, they work out a lot. But if you can't follow it because it's too hard, there's no point. So set yourself up for success. Create a system, a structure, a schedule that you cannot break. Another big thing that \nSeek Accountability \ncould help is having any level of accountability. Top line of this would be having a coach, having someone who's checking in on you, holding you accountable, helping you create structure, and just checking in on you essentially so you know you have accountability somewhere. absolutely huge. Not everyone can afford that. So sometimes having things like a friend who's doing it with \nyou, maybe a partner who supports you, let your wife, girlfriend, whatever know that this is super important to you, be on top of me, track me, work on these things, help me work through this stuff. Beyond that, if you don't have that, if you have friends who lift, hang around the gym. You'll probably find some. But even my app, the standard community, we have the transformation challenge. We have standard plus. We have weekly calls. We have a circle group chat. We have all these chats hanging out in there that people can meet and talk to each other and hang out there as they're working through their goals. And just being around that energy. You are who you surround yourself with. So being around that is super helpful. All right. So a \nPost-Meal Walks \nbig thing that I struggle with cuz I live in Florida, but it I'm when I do it, I feel way better is doing a 10-minute walk after every single meal that you eat. There's two reasons why. a lowers cortisol, helps your digestion, lowers your blood sugar and it's so good for you. They've literally done studies comparing this to metformin and it's had very similar effects. Stan effort efing have been talking about this for like 20 years and they're just doing studies on now proving it. Again, bodybuild is always head of the science. Just saying it. He's also a really smart dude though, so do that. But people who don't want to do cardio, don't want to do all this stuff to be able to just eat and then just go walk around for 10 minutes is not that hard. If you're structuring your day properly, you have time for that and it'll be so much more benefit to your body. And same thing like I was talking about for the cardio. If you don't want to do cardio for an hour or whatever, just getting in more steps in a day is super efficient. So if you're someone who has phone calls in a day or you're listening to a podcast or you just have breaks throughout the day instead of sitting\nthere scrolling your phone or doing nothing or sitting on a couch on the phone or behind your desk on the phone, put your AirPods in, headphones, whatever you got and go walk around the parking lot, walk around the building, whatever it may be, and figure it out. and help you get in much better shape much faster. Talk about this a lot \nDigestive Health \nwhen it comes to a bulk but cutting just as important digest digestion can't say that word either is absolutely huge when it comes to anything optimizing progress for your body when it comes to building muscle or burning fat. So being able to do things like eat food in a conscious state, if you're in a high stress state, eating food, not really chewing, swallowing, like big pieces, that's going to create bad digestion, mess up your gut, not be able to absorb nutrients properly. Again, like I keep talking about, spike your cortisol, hold on fat more, just ruin a lot of things. So having digestive supplements if you need to take a betain HCL before you eat, some gut health products, something that's going to help you digest, digest enzymes, whatever it may be. But even just being off your phone, chewing your food more, being intentional with it, doing those 10 minutes walks after every single meal can help you so much in progressing and moving forward. And just these little tips and things that you can add throughout the day. And the more touch points that you have in the day that are progressing you towards your goal, the more conscious you are of your goal and the more likely you're going to continue to make good decisions. to doing that on top of creating a plan while you're at the beginning of the day or have the beginning of the weekend full of energy and follow that plan when you're tired throughout. You're setting yourself up for success and you're in a much better position than most people. So, at the end of the day, cutting sucks. It can be hard. It can be also be easy when you get to a certain point, but if you want to get shredded, it's not always fun. But if you want to get something, got to go through hard [beep] sometimes. It's just the way it is. If you want to drive results that most people don't get, you have to do things that most people won't do, and it's the way it is. So, all these tips and tricks are something that help and there's so much more I could talk about and even myself now being on a diet and progressing forward in all the YouTube videos to come, I'll keep implementing little tips and tricks and showing you how I'm doing it and adapting what I'm trying, what's worked for me, what doesn't. So, I'll continue to talk about this cuz there's so much more that you can do. But at the end of the day, like I said, create a plan, stick to it, check your food, eat healthy food, and take care of your body because being healthy is what matters. So, have a good reason to do what you're doing, and it will work out better in the end. Yeah, that's my ramble on cutting for the day. So, I hope you guys enjoyed this. If you guys want to see me ramble on other random topics, plan in life, let me know. Like I said, I will continuously be talking about this stuff going forward. So, thank you guys for watching. I'll see you later. \nHere's the second video's transcript on cutting"

\ngym been pouring rain so I always feel much more tired on rainy days I don't \nknow why my eyes are just like heavy but I slept good last night so it's good Justin's got the new pink lemonade bum \nenergy coming to convenience stores near you soon hopefully so go in your gas \nstations and tell them you need B Energy there maybe we'll get them there but we're going to hit some back some \nshoulders that's it hopefully don't get soaked on the way over there try to wake up and roll it five four three two \none good long arm long arm reach reach reach reach then \ntwist like that doesn't hurt but it feels weak and that's 10 okay \nbut what about pain give it a number for pain \nthree okay so it's not not too bad okay it's the more weight though it's like yeah then you feel it uh both arms \nshoulder blades down bring your arms back as far as you \ncan so tell me how this side feels different nothing right now a pain but \nit feels like tighter \nokay that that little motion there in about right here yeah it's kind of more \nwhen you like getting pulled out and that's when you feel it yeah okay go sh it off lay on your back wait from here do you notice changing hand positions if it does \nanything or no not that I noticed okay so you'll just be here you're going to push into me and then you're going to \nlift off with about 50% so push into me like down that way like you're doing a reverse we'll do it like this I'll be \neasier push push push push push push push now \nlift it's definitely\nbetter still in there but it's better \nslightly we'll keep playing with it by the time we get everything warm uh and we actually get to that we'll we'll get a better idea of what it is good four three two one \ntwo is there a pause at the bottom of this one or no pause just don't rush out of it two more \ntwo one four three two \nyep 3 \nfour one more four three two yep \nI feel fine with this much l yeah do a couple more just get a lot of \nblood two one more and you can dip them lower as \nwell for yep like down there exactly I feel that \nmy mid back yeah head back drop the elbows \nmore y low low low lowow low like that then up so that's technically what it \nshould be but we'll do what you you've been doing for it there's no reason to change at this point so just do whatever is comfortable yep and let \ngood all the big ones are on the bottom yeah you did \nhundo all right here we go quick up four three two one yeah take \nyour time out top four 3 two one then speed four 3 two and go four 3 two yep that's \ngood doing another warmy here this is the like three three with \nthe intensity spread if it's knocked out in two it's knocked out in two and the final ones are rest paws go to failure \ngo back in 15 seconds later what do you mean if it's kned out too uh like if if \nyou're at a peak glow by set two then it's then we'll do the rest paw then or then we'll do the rest pause then yeah I \nmean I'll need a more warm up here than I will there okay you want another one here then let's go um depends how much \nlighter you think I should go I still felt light \nokay if you legitimately hit the hundreds I would imagine with the change in Tempo \nwhat did I just do that we'll end up doing the '90s for more reps I don't think we'll end up jumping up to the 100\n10 the 110 like going up and load what was the last load I just did you just did the 60 60 yeah so we'll hit an 80 \nwe'll hit an 80 see how that feels 4 3 2 one good how's your shoulder \nfeel on that fine fine okay we'll start on the Arnold \npress uh how does it feel kicking them up fine I used to kick you up \nlike 130s or normal so this is light this is very \nlight and then just if anything feels different right to left any uh any \ncommunication will help me have a better idea of like what's going on with the shoulder I have some ideas right now but we'll uh we'll play around with \nit 4 3 2 1 2 4 3 2 \n1 4 3 2 one po 4 3 2 1 one go 4 3 2 one \ngo 4 3 two one go four 3 two full \nextension 4 3 two one up one \nmore two one \ngo done there Four 3 2 \none two four 3 2 \n1 4 3 2 \n1 Four 3 2 one there's five four 3 2 \n1 6 \nseven good keep driving the shoulder down think about reaching there you go now go four 3 two one two more \ngo give me one more here and go four three two one good \nperfect so because we're leaving room in terms of \nintensity for the later portion of prep because the tempo is more \ncontrolled and because the shoulders are going to respond to Tad better to a higher rep range we're going to do the \n90s even if it falls between 12 and 15 in this case that'll be good that one \nwill still tick to uh s to the 10 and then this one has the rest pods \nbut the set is the first like mini set is complete when you can't get full extension so make sure you still get \nfull extension control the four down and on the last one don't drop still get the four down they'll go to your knees it's\n10 seconds you'll kick them up and you're rolling by the time we get to 15 the same thing yeah yeah same \nthing 4 3 2 one quick Four 3 2 1 2 4 3 2 \n1 4 3 2 one four 3 two one spe spe spe spe four \nthree two one up four 3 2 one all the \nway up all the way up four three two one up four 3 two \none up all the way all the way go another four three two one \nup four three go for one more and \nup okay four three two 10 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 \n3 two start kicking them up aggressive out of the bottom holy \none to three more Four 3 two one two four three two one up \nup up up up four 3 two one up up up up \nfour down three two that's good oh we \nalready pumped the shreds oh just pure delt pure delt like in a good \nway good delt good delt oh good we like good delt it like every part of \nit was just like the delt was just holding it that's good I'm telling you this the \na series at least for this phase that's the that's the ticket is the time under \ntension and the eent that's what we want so that's good would you say that like the biggest low hanging fruit for most \npeople and success and bodybuilding trading is time M tension on the \nentric 100% you create more muscle damage in the Ecentric that's not the \nonly way to get hypertrophy but that's one of the main ways you get hypertrophy yeah and Ecentric are one of the fastest \nways to build strength and strengths the mother of all qualities for hypertrophy especially if you get stronger so \nEcentric it's all \ncorrelated 10 reps try to Arch the back low back s try \nto Arch your back one \nmore see if it feels better for you instead of doing both feet right next to each other whatever side is growing pop \nthat foot back slightly cuz in the bottom instead of being here you're this\nis tucked just the very bottom is yeah which is fine but it's not as stable not \nand I don't want to like light your low back up yeah but \nwhat loads have you been using with this and what was the tempo like I think I was doing like 110 110 \nokay good on the shoulder uh whatever stance is more \ncomfortable I'm indifferent just whatever you feel more stable in but if it's both feet next to each other we can \ndo that doesn't make a difference feels more comfortable to do feet beside each other cuz I've always done it do that then that's fine here we go the top go \nthree two I want three more big contraction squeeze squeeze squeeze three two Big Stretch pause speed three \ntwo keep the sternum up sternum up and go three two one that's \ngood so especially for you making sure that your midback is nice and developed \nwhen you row it's not to say we can never do this but if you're rowing like this and you're not getting this extra \nscapular depression and keeping your sternum up then you're missing the shortening of that and like we talked \nabout what moves the most or moves first a lot of time is uh recruited the most \nobviously is why my back's wide in the lat I don't have the same thickness there so you being able to row and keep \nthis here and get this as opposed to just this will'll make a difference in the \nmid but that was good that was good we'll \ngo two to two and a half minutes we'll hit another one same thing and then \nwe'll move on 3 2 one dead stop good sit in the \nstretch pause then go good and go three two two one pause go 3 \n2 one pause go good you got three \nmore two elbow just a tad higher pause up and back three two one five \nretractions back and down five stretch four good minimize the turn three just \nthis two back one more one good H yeah that's \ngood that's good three two one \ngo \ntwo three as long as it feels good you can speed up the Ecentric ATT\nTad you can speed the Centric up a tad if it feels good \n5 three two one go six three two one \ngo good good stretch big squeeze there we go two \nmore nine last one 10 three two we're rolling in 10 \nhere we go drop it 10 9 8 7 six get \nset and let's go three two same stretch \ngo two three two one go three three two \none four good control three two one \ngo let's go two more two \none more \ngood 9 8 7 Get Set let's go eight reps \nthree two one two three two \none 3 three two one four good \nfive last three \nthree squeeze squeeze squeeze make it difficult \ntwo one three two one that's good all \nright all \nright one more of those now we'll go shoulders 75 seconds and we we hit 3 two one squeeze the dumbbells three two 1 3 2 1 3 2 1 3 2 1 3 2 one speed control the top good reach three two one \ngood Tad higher and control it three last two two nice and controlled push away push away two good 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 chest \nup push away three two one \ntwo right back up three right back up four Reach For Me reach for me three two one go control it three two \none go another control it good done 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 two let's go 3 2 1 two two right back up \nthree four let's go stay in there five right \nback up six you're recruiting the muscle fibers you want right now get as much as you can out of it right back up control right back up one more one more get up\ndone that's good okay now we got rest that's good though that's \ngood one more on the pull over and then we'll come back here how was the grip towards the end on the first one the fat \ngrips fine it was slipping on bed yeah sliping a little bit hard for me not to engage my traps uh just in general on these specifically on lateral raes on a standing lateral \nrace yeah or any lateral race one thing we can do is put you on a slight incline \nbench you being here is going to take the trap out of it but it requires more of a stretch you can try it on this next \none it'd be a good thing to know if you feel it more in your delts for future programs so we can try that be less load \nprobably or what will be the same load or less uh slightly less likely but \nwe'll uh yeah we'll go down to the 20s that's \njust such a big drop such a big drop doing four sets already for me it's \nlike oh yeah you're dogging that's the battle well and that's where all the \nlittle the little tricks come out instead of you just being a a victim to \nhow many sets can you do and how many reps we find methods and ways to get the same stimulus but with less or by \nplaying with variables so that it feels fresher yeah so you're not getting the same fatigue eight \ns 6 \nfive four last three \ngood two more two last one big squeeze feel it on the \nway out three two one that's good done with \nthose very nice 75 then we'll try the variation on \nthe lateral race three two \none good come on two more two more get up three two keep reaching one more three two drop those eight 7 6 two good and come back then \ngo four push that down Fast Five \ncontrol six here we go we're getting to 10 seven control Tad \nhigher eight control stretch nine control \nstretch 10 control that's good more or less in the Trap left left\nokay so that'd be that especially later in prep like if your neck starts bugging \nthat' be a really good one to switch that helps you technically it's supposed to be two sets but we're going to do the \nthree sets since we're pulling on the reverse way all right so 10 12 15 and \neach of them should be like an RM like a 10 RM then 12 RM then a 15 RM is it full range or I trying just \npull my re delts or just full yeah your rear delt is going to it's going to work \non that and it'll grow like crazy from it too yeah we'll just go warming here get a feel even just not used to being like \ntucked in like that yeah I felt it like I feel like probably one of those muscles that you said needs to be like \nretaught like post surely how to sit it like just burning in my like inside my joint cap in a good way not like pain wide grip the elbows are going to \npull High I don't want shrugging elbows High shoulder blades are still repressed depressed and the focus is the amount of \nspread you can get in the shoulder blades and then how far you can get them together with elbows back without this \ngoing here three two one two going to get that elbow back \neven further chest up three there you go now control it speed control three two one three two one speed elbow three two \none go fight to control this two one three two \nagain three two one more up up up up up elbows control to good that's \ngood 6 3 two now control the top go 7 \nthree two come on fight it control two \none three more three here we go all the way up all the \nway up control two in the stretch I'll help it control the shoulders pull pull \npull pull pull now control three two \ngood Stones left unturned in the sense of loading to where if we can dial \nloading even a little bit more you'll get an even better stimulus because of how much we had to drop to get the extra \nreps usually like perfect scenario we would have done three plates for 10 let's say we would have done a 10%\ndifference 5 to 10% difference so we would have done like three plates like \n25 and like a five and you would get extra reps whereas we got close to the \nsame so how do we adjust that you're saying just making sure so like part of it is knowing what loads you've done and \ntypically drop too much not necessarily too much but maybe what you're doing week to week like how are we finding all \nthe little ways to improve like are you going to have the best physique possible with the way you're doing things different this year without a doubt in my mind but that's like that's with us tweaking let's say 50% this is looking for another 10% yeah that ju \njust looking at as like okay what are you wanting to do this year making sure no sounds left unturned like those are \nlittle things we can play with but so just tracking it more efficiently tracking it more efficiently and then \njust us having more conversations about how to adjust things yeah which is partially me seeing the loads and then \nbeing able to tell you like okay that was put the loads in one week next week you can like tell me what the drop to Y \njust tell you adjustments yeah but really we can do it in whatever manner we need to like I don't care if it's \nthrough the app it could literally be like it's kind of annoying but like I've even had athletes where it's like like \ntake a picture that was my top set and they just end of the work like send everything over it's like oh that was \nyour trap or your T Bar like okay cool two one and \nout two one good Big Stretch then wrap \ntwo one try to get the wrist back two one \nstretch two one two one good hold it a tad longer \ntwo one out there you go two \none get two more two one back just a tad more squeeze and hold two one that's good right in right in good fast on the way up go 10 keep \ngoing 11 12 13 Even though the rain's suffering \nkeep it going 14 long arms long arms 15 reach for the ground 16 to 20 \n17 18 minimize this push 19 20 \ngood that's good heavy 5 lb dumbbells I know uh where did you feel that\nmost upper back trap come I was feeling in my rear dels the whole time and then my mid traps were pulling a bit when I was arching chugging too much okay this \nis one where we were talking about how you hunched forward you won't get as much midback this one we're \nintentionally trying to not move the shoulder blades as much and just get the movement here \nthis one I want shoulder blade then that one I don't yeah we're pref fatiguing scap retractors and then we extend with \nrud Del two two go push this down once you \nget it in three three four four good don't tuck the chin \nlift five five six six hands closer to the face \nseven seven get it back get it back eight eight little more \nrange nine nine there you go here we go 10 10 that's \ngood 6 \n7 eight nine good push 10 give it a little \nspeed on the whip 11 pumping out now 12 right back up 13 right back up \n14 15 reach reach reach 16 17 reach 18 reach \n19 20 good \nespecially legs typically but yeah yeah you definitely want it far far away from training it's nice in your case with uh \nuh with what you have IG nephropathy just for inflammation mhm it's good for that but yeah it definitely needs to be \nfar away like the people that disagree like oh no like you can do it close to training that I've heard at least aren't \ntrying to maximize everything like there's literally a study that I don't know if it was just published or if it \nmight have been like a 2018 2019 um but they found it was a good way to decrease muscle mass like so the way you can \ninterpret the study calde talks about it like if you have an athlete who has a \nweight cap you could have them do a cold plunge post training MH and then it would like inhibit they like hypertrophy \ngains because it inhibits the inflam uh like the inflammatory process and they can still get like good strength gains \nnot as good but as long as it's far enough away then then you're fine and\nthen the sa is is great like post especially if it's like a far infrared sauna it'll actually increase the effectiveness really yeah you just have to make sure that post trainining you switch from sympathetic to parasym sympathetic bring the heart rate down chill out first and then go into that yeah because if you're go go go go go it's too much I was good \nwith that with prep last year and I'll do it again I'm sure I used to lie on the ground in there in front of a fan and just like do like a meditation or \njust chill for close your eyes breathe yeah and then I saw rattlesnake across the road and I petrified that there'd be \none in the gym with me and then never again never again yeah performance \nis a lot of times dictated by recovery so faster you can recover the better performance you get and my obsession \nwith sleep too \nright what do you want me to say say goodbye goodbye"

Transcript \nGenerated on 2025-11-05 (Asia/Seoul) \nno that leaves Remnant bro no remant people I think Americans the fact that we don't have days is crazy you do I mean bed are amazing we ordered one too this is going to sound weird but as you aim you gota you gotta do the open close yeah well you yeah you got to move around no no no a slight spincter opening and Clos goes up in once it goes up in why does your spinter get so dilated bro oh cuz I do it for the for the B oh because here's the other I do it I do it for Calvin I I didn't know I didn't know until a year ago that when you wipe I didn't know this that you don't go inside I go in a little bit when I oh that's why I thought this was normal that's how the vry gets so dilated like in like how deep knuckle this this one [Laughter] like no like that much I want go in how do you not rip the toilet paper no because that's what you poke through you you do Alabama wet wi that explains everything that's where you spit on the toilet paper you spit on your finger and then stuck up spit on the toilet paper and then you go in yeah I didn't know that D yeah I was trying to be clean and thorough yeah how's it I do my best to be thorough especially now that I have a [ __ ] bacterial gut infection not fun you put hydration here that's for me lot of sodium that's for me what is up YouTube today day one of high carb day I had two high carb meals last night four today which means I'm about a little over 600 G to carv deep and a long way to go so kind give me a little bit of strawberry lemoned gly right now some carb powder to make it a little easier to get a bunch of carbs in me CU I'm an open bodybuild now I got to shove them down cuz I'm [ __ ] huge uh yeah we're hitting a little bit of back a little bit of posing little upper body it's Thursday so I'm barely going to train go home and eat a bunch more food so I'll get this workout done then show you guys what we're eating later tonight what he said muffins not today maybe tomorrow might get some muffins tomorrow oh man down down down down or what tomorrow the muffins are coming how many muffins how many you going to tell me to eat or how many am I going to eat how many are you going to eat oh God we don't know yet depends how many my stomach can fill up got to be more than chag D there's no Costco Costco Costco mu bro European bakeries I mean I do agree they're probably that's it that's it see how better you thought I'm so skinny right do I feel heavy no okay just trying get 12 relax chest up F obviously there's no we cap so we don't have to worry about weighing in so that has a huge difference and now what we're going to do is really try to com combine his conditioning with bit more fullness so we can get more of a 3D look on stage so that's what the goal is so it's a different look than what we were chasing before and then also the timing is going to be a lot different because now we have to double Peak because this show has prejudging 800m on Saturday and then 24 hours later the other 50% of the judging is going to be done on Sunday evening so we have to go in looking great and then keeping it for the next night so there's a lot of differences between these shows I have to say the biggest difference though is what's already happened I didn't have to make weight today so we weren't struggling I was 245 I was in shape I look good I didn't have to cut water I could eat more food when I'm 245 I look good but then we got to get down to 241 to make weight so the difference is before and now it's still just make sure I'm leaning full yeah so ideal look is what a bit bigger try to keep as much conditioning as close to what you had Olympia but a bit bigger is that that's the all these words mean they have no Jed definition but you spend enough time in bodybuilding and like Fuller versus bigger versus dry leer you know they're all different you can do a row there's two different rowing machines there's this one which doesn't actually feel bad at all good and then there's also like a hammer style one I saw both\nlike that feels good come on Chris bring that scapula back there you go good good keep going squeeze squeeze squeeze squeeze squeeze good let's go good now bring your elbows down the rest of the set that's better go good good keep going two more one more just one more set like that with your elbows down feel good yeah feel the difference as you Dro your elbows yeah I just think of like getting ready to hit your tree pose up on stage with that St squeeze Goode one one more good job little AB yeah just a little bit you ra this here do knees or I think there was was there a crunch like a bench crunches there you go [Music] good bring up a little bit one more one more that's it just do a couple sets I think yesterday we went to the beach here and that was a picture of me you're right in Fr of other squeeze your chest maybe that's you got two days got to keep eating we big old bowl of salmon and rice this is meal number 3 it's Friday 36 hours before stepping on stage eaten approximately 1,200 G of carbs since the beginning of the carb up and nothing no muffins yet so still working on muffins somewhere they're hidden cuz I'll eat them they're hidden cuz Jack eat them hey I was eying them this morning me too Paige said I couldn't eat them but I'm going to get my first coat of 10an right now put this meal Down Still skinny so got a lot of food to get in still pale so got a lot of tan to get get on so see you guys there ready for a the [Music] [Music] all right so we're back in action in the tanning game I was just saying how it feels I've only done the Olympia where it's like big theatrics and press conferences and meetings and meet greets and all this crazy stuff here we just pull up in a van in the back we're still setting up backstage tanning back here alone it feels like the good old days so it's nice and Casual which I like we just chilling so it's also cold right now the doors open we're in Czech Czech Republic they call it now czechia say check check say ches I piss off on yeah I'm not going to say that and it's cold out doors are open they got a fan on me and I'm naked getting sprayed down with cold water that's why I'm cold right now but hopefully I dry quick let we get the hell out of here e some muffins we're rolling let me take a look backstage last spray T never it's my last spray T this is stuff I won't this part's are fun sometimes especially with Kelly Kelly's a goat with protan but shaving pre-shaving and stuff sitting in the shower for 2 hours a day just bicking your body away not going to miss that no more baby dolphin Christopher be a hairy [ __ ] Woodsman So Good Times the last for everything unless there was a comeback why you decided to do this I've been talking about doing this for years okay almost every year after the Olympia look to see if there's an open show close by in Florida or something or even in the US and there hasn't been been one and this year there still wasn't one and I'm like [ __ ] it if I'm ever going to do it this is the only time I can ever do it so I found one in Europe and was talking to Martin one day about it he's like if you do it I'll do it and I wanted to compare myself to a top pro at some point and just see without trying without putting on the weight just my classic physique look beside an open Pro look and he said he would do it so I was like screw it why not yeah he didn't know at the time he was going to be a top four look that's even better yeah yeah I knew he was going to do well but top four is even better yeah had a bunch of moments leading into this being like why am I still dieting but then I'm like it's 3 weeks and for the rest of my life I'm going to be like what would they looked like beside one of those guys you know you can crop beside each other but it's just not the same so living with no regret I saw a cool clip of a an F1 race and it was someone against Alonzo and he was like his the quote over top of it was he has a wife and daughter at home I knew he was going to break and he just sent it into the corner and the other guy break and he passed him and won the race and it's like different times and different parts of your life you know are you trying to win the race or are you trying to live your life with what you care about you know were there part of me with 5 years ago that might have done it or if I was alone and single might have done it maybe that's not what I want in my life right now you know I'd rather break into that corner and go home to my wife and kids I still feel like I lived that though you know like the last 5 years I haven't breaken break in any Corner they were just doing it you know I've lived my life and\nnow I get the other side of it so I don't feel like I'm missing anything you 100% have to when they do like the pose down you have to come off stage off stage and just like go on the crowd of maybe yeah never done that once in I did I multiple guest posings yeah that's guest POS this is the show to do this is it whenever they do that pose down it's like 30 seconds go by and then you're like all right I can only do this for so long Calvin knows from many asking you many question you ever asked me what's my favorite what's the most what's the number one I can't answer it what will you miss what will I miss in general yeah it doesn't have to be the most the Simplicity the daily purpose like the moments where I'm taking a nap and it has a purpose you know I'm resting and it has a purpose I'm doing nothing all day and eating and going to the gym and getting to bed betterly and there's the purpose to it you know there's no purpose to that anymore I'm not it's not making me better at something just a simple like progress which I'll really miss and obviously the community around competing like the week before and you know it's it's something that brings people together for a a purpose you know like we wouldn't all just hang out get every be in Prague or even at the Olympia we all wouldn't just be in the Trump Hotel hanging out doing [ __ ] like it's always an event where people come together and it's a reason to be excited to like get emotional to connect and do things and you know gonna have to find something else a trip and vacation is one thing but like an event that's like people know that they care about you and you tied a lot of like sacrifice and emotion into it it just leads to More Beautiful Moments memories there a lot of things I'll miss a lot I won't right though I feel like whenever I I don't enjoy going on vacation a few more setup shots before we go you ready walking around like his just on the [Laughter] what's up how are you man good brother how you doing good feeling got a cute matching wearing her jersey she's wearing my jersey how are you we haven't really officially met but a little bit how are you I'm good you good are you guys both done

Gym Project \n[Music] \num \nand then i'll make myself some pancakes \ni would do the same thing what \nis up youtube welcome back to success \nfrom the olympia we're bored today don't \nknow what the [ __ ] we're gonna do so \ni'll be filming a q a that i was \nsupposed to do last week \nthat we completely disregarded first \nthings first though \ni woke up and my instagram was verified \ni'm officially \nan official instagram influencer \nso pretty good day i can die happy now \ngreat success \nbut finishing up my cardio right now \nwe're gonna kind of go through the day \nand do like \ntwo one to two questions at a time doing \nrandom [ __ ] and yeah \nthis one's from rj underscore callahan \nhe said what is your first \ni should have prepared what is your \nfirst meal going to be post show \nafter you take your second classic \nmithril title \nfirst meal i never really know what the \n[ __ ] i'm gonna get but i've been craving \nsandwiches a lot \nlike a really good like big sub deli \ntype sandwich maybe a panini or \nsomething like that \nfor some reason i've been craving that a \nlot patent like tacos \nso maybe some [ __ ] like that and then \nwe're probably going to go around \nsee what ian wants he's competing to \nobviously whatever anyone's input is \nwe'll go for that or whatever the hell's \nopen when we finish the show \nit will depend next question is would\n1 \nyou say you improved your arms best or your back \nin back back \nback the back shot \nlike the back double will be a more improved pose \nthan like any but like your back double and your front double and like they all incorporate your arms but the back double shot will be \nthe most improved yeah \nbecause of the background most drastic change will be my back from the back double \nyes more so than my arms from the front double yes yes \nbut if you're gonna just like nitpick what might have improved more like if you're like getting at the measuring tape \nmaybe your arms but i don't know they both improved a lot so it's hard to say yeah there's your kind of answer i'll do one more question here and then we'll move on somewhere else when do when do you decide to have a low calorie day and a high calorie day \ni don't ian does and i've had \ntwo high days i've had 23 in a 14 week prep \nyeah so yeah i don't said he does and i don't i really get them \nIce Bath \ntime for the ice bath this was a mission to get all these bags \nand fit them in the fridge at the end of the night so \nbetter be cold enough \n[Applause] \nall right kids here we go \nthere's a lot more hardcore with actual ice \npeople would ask me how much ice to do i really don't know \nbut i don't have my clothes at home but this\n2 \nis a total of 60 pounds \nof ice does that \nmake sense wait well it's only good for one what there's only different one top [Applause] \nit's always the worst part \nit's gonna overflow \ni'm gonna get my legs in here \n[Applause] \nyeah this is a little baby it's just \nsmall tough \ni feel like a giant in a little tub like i'm living in a house for ants \ni understand bend your knees i want it for my legs anyways being in like florida humid heat \ncoming from dry canada cold your body naturally dampens the climate just retains more water especially \nfor me my lower body so this is my kind of a health \nattempt to bring some of the \ninflammation i've already been flushing it out pretty good naturally \nthis is also naturally but yeah so i feel like it's always colder when it's like just above in the water \noh yeah when it hits your chest it definitely gets cold legs are easy to handle \nso being a bit of a [ __ ] right now but this was this \ni'm gonna fire up the next question if i can find them \non my phone all right next question from colin \nravier ravioli ravio i don't know \nhe said how many calories were you eating as a teenager and were they clean calories \ni was eating a lot of calories i don't know how much probably \n4 500. at one point i remember in high school \ni was talking about this i'd have like eight hard-boiled eggs in the morning\n3 \nand like six pieces of toast covered in peanut butter \nand then i'd bring like two chicken rice meals to school i'd have looked pretty much lasagna every day or my mom would like make meatloaf or something i'd have these like meat and mass shakes that were like \n1200 calories and i would drink \nhomogenized milk which is 3.25 \nmilk and i was like a savage eating just like nasty [ __ ] like that so \ni was eating a lot of the kid and i was like \nprobably 220 pounds at the end of high school grade 12 training since grade nine \nor 10-ish like weight training and eating pretty good so \ni ate a lot don't know exactly how much how important is getting enough sleep for weight loss in general \nand for you now during prep i'm like [ __ ] such a big believer in sleep being extremely important \nand i didn't really realize i was like that but even in prep if i'm like up in the middle and i am with some people like \ngo to cardio i'm gonna do a pose and blah blah like i will force myself to go back to bed \nand make sure i get like eight hours of sleep because i think sleep is so crucial \nif your body's in like a state of stress and it's not getting in the breast and relaxation \nand all the hormones you release when you're in a deep sleep that digestion you get that period of a catabolic safe no food in you for that extended time i think it's just so crucial for all \nfunctions of your body work properly so whether you're trying to put on weight something i've told actually a\n4 \nlot it's off season because he didn't sleep a lot \noh they grow you're bulking you're eating a lot you're trying to grow you need \neven more sleep eight hours plus a nap a day and train your ass off for two hours in the gym \nand you're doing good so sleep very important \nheinz or french's ketchup 100 \nheinz ketchup heinz ketchup but french is \nmustard remember that how important is visualization and meditation for you this is something i've only started doing in like the last eight \nsix to eight months or so since the summer and i think it's helped me i can't even like put on a scale how much time it's helped me so much keeping my mind calm \nwhen i need it and just being more present in moments i notice i can just like fly by things \nfeel stressed and be stressed and be like okay just like who cares just feel fresh \nbut do what you got to do i'm taking a breath and like \nhaving those times of meditation visualization to like be present and like be like there's nothing stressed about you should be enjoying this journey \nthis is your choice all that [ __ ] i \nthink it's super important \nand specific visualization towards something i'm doing like stepping on stage posing \nthat's something where i have to find out next saturday when i get on stage after i've visualized this so many times throughout days and nights throughout this prep i've seen myself do it and i'm gonna do it for real next week so\n5 \nwe'll see just how important it is next week \nso \nso \nit's not so fresh \ndriving a race car when you're over the back wheels \nif the rear wheel drive \ni'll close the doors holy hell \noh yep i feel like i'm one week out that's pretty i'm sure \nexactly how we should feel though ugh \nit's not a pillow boy anymore what we don't have a pillow boy anymore boy yeah what's that mean matt where's your pillow boy \nthe pillow boy just last year \nhe carried your pillow around did he it's pretty beauty \nmatt we miss you very sad maddie milkshake couldn't make it but \nwe'll be seeing him soon enough Gym \nall right so we're heading to the gym quickly gonna answer those \nmore questions let's see where \nwas i do you get nervous before getting on stage \nnerves how do you deal with them i'm not sure what's gonna happen this year but up until last year \ni still had nerves yet last year but they were like much less i'm someone who hates presenting and being in front of big crowds and i get like \nheart pounding lose my breath and it's hard for me to focus and when i'm out there it takes me a while to relax i definitely do get nervous but last year \nthe week leaving up i had a really good like mental week and everything and i was pretty like fired up and i \nwas able to calm those nerves through like listening to music i would listen\n6 \nto the book called relentless \nby tim grover and it's just like getting in the zone trying to like be like focus as [ __ ] and just like amping myself up in my mind \nseparating myself from everyone getting off instagram not [ __ ] worrying about anything other than just trusting myself and that helped a lot this year i feel just like \nmore confident than i ever have and i've practiced my posing more than i have so i think it's going to be \na lot there's still going to be nerves waiting but i think before sitting on stage i'm going to feel \nthe most peace and confidence i've ever felt so i'm excited \nto see how my body mind reacts have you and ian ever been in a fist fight \ni wanted to pick this one but we haven't been in the fifth place there was one time \nback like the first or second year milton ian met we went to a bar and got really [ __ ] up and he doesn't drink that he doesn't drink ever anymore but he was like wasted the other night like dad and i was in his ear like whispering things i was like yeah and like going back and forth in the end of night when you're just like at the counter of his house just like dead and then i was like joking with him i put him in a headlock and we kind of [ __ ] around he like shoved me and then i \nlike ran like put him in a headlock and i was \nblasted wasted in my mind too and he like got actually angry because he was so tired and i was laughing my sister was laughing \nand i remember he just like took me and like threw me over put me on the ground\n7 \nand put me in a headlock and i was just like drunk just like done \nlike out of commission and he just put me out so it was pretty [ __ ] funny what i would do for a video of that it was hilarious but not a fist fight but i think that's the only time we've ever like gotten in like a physical tough tefl ruffle whatever \naltercation \nall right so i picked this one because it's food related it's cookies \nwaffles muffins pancakes rank them best to worst this is really difficult \ni wish i didn't pick it now because i have no idea \ni want to put pancakes at the top because i know courtney can make them super healthy \nand i like eating healthy good food now there's so much variation you can do with peanut butter fruit \njust maple syrup i couldn't think of maple syrup well i can't talk so they're up there \nand then probably muffins \nare going to be next i have this weird love for muffins they like that they're like \nthick rather than cookies they're thin but they're really close with cookies really close i like muffins like being thick and warm \nand like oatmeal muffins also courtney makes healthy ones with those and i just i like healthier food right now \nnext would probably be cookies because contrast all that stuff i like crispy cookies that are almost overcooked sometimes like the holiday special pillsbury cookies are amazing with sugar cookies \ncrispy cookies are just [ __ ] good again oatmeal cookies are my go-to and then waffles are going to be last because i don't really know who the [ __ ]\n8 \neats waffles \never well they're obviously amazing i love waffles but they're just like \nit was a waffle maker i just i never eat them so i'm gonna probably \nget roasted for this and i would regret almost saying i'm confident in this but pancakes \nmuffins cookies waffles in that order Questions \nall right so we just wrapped up worked out at the gym \ndid a little bit of help shoulder to chest almost forgot \nbut we're gonna move on to the questions first question \nof this section what is the hardest part of the final weeks before \nshow for you this changes every year depending on what's going on \nthis year it's honestly been the \nexcitement i'm really [ __ ] excited to get up there and i feel like i'm \ngoing to be ready for sure and i just want to like showcase it and \nbe there so that's kind of like that impatience is getting to me \nbut also the subtle thing that's been difficult this year is \ncoveted to be completely honest it's like part of me is like \njust like [ __ ] you got sick before that would suck but i don't even want to put that in the universe but it's \nit's there a little bit but it's not \ngoing to happen so [ __ ] it \ndid i even say that but yeah that's probably \nit for that next question do you keep up with other athletes \nor brian keep up with brienne's physique update or other athletes \nand how close do you think it will be this year this is \nor the first year that i haven't kept up with [ __ ]\n9 \nanybody i muted everyone i follow and i just don't really go through my feed and i don't see anyone \ni get technician i just don't click it i really haven't been \nand sometimes i'll like screenshot myself and compare it literally \ncollage it besides someone else like hitting the same pose \nlast year i did that and i just didn't do that this year focused on myself and just said [ __ ] you to everybody and didn't look at it and it's kind of kept my mind at ease it kept me really focused on just \nmyself and knowing if i show up at my best that's all that [ __ ] matters so that's the goal haven't compared or kept up with anybody this year and honestly it feels really good so if you can avoid it if you're competing do it it's my first year doing it and it feels great \nMore Questions \nall right so end the day headed to bed now we're gonna wrap it up with three more questions \nand continue this tomorrow because we got some good questions coming in first question today tonight \nis a doozy said would you rather your girl \nsound like a zombie during sex or sound like your dad \ni would say without a doubt a zombie sherry's having a laughing zombie over there oh my god \ndefinitely don't sound like my dad at least but i would definitely go with zombie \nbecause i don't want to be thinking of my dad during doing the dirty that's just \nno no no no no all right \nall right next question first thing you would do\n10 \nafter winning this year's olympia first thing i'm going to do \nmy favorite thing to do is i come outside and after i have a little cry to myself \ni get to see courtney i get to see my parents melissa ian \ncalvin maddie if he makes it probably not i don't know but i get to see like the crew \nmy squad my family my loved ones get to come out and just like hug them and like share this moment of \nall this [ __ ] they've seen me go through all the [ __ ] and just kind of like \nhave that experience with them every single year something i remember and cherish every time i get off stage so probably what i'm looking forward to the most tips on aspiring \nolympian athletes i think he means people who want to go to olympia my tip would be to take it easy and start small \ndon't start your journey trying to be mr olympia i did not want to be mr olympia until i \ncame second at the olympia and i was like oh [ __ ] maybe i can misspell to you have your goals set them small see what's right in front of you \notherwise it's going to feel \noverwhelming and you're going to give up and it's just going to feel too \ndifficult \nso if you're never competing before make your goal to compete \nor to work out or to put on some muscle or whatever the hell your goal is if you've \nbeen competing for a while make your pro goalie get your pro card and slowly work your way up the ladder \nand don't just be someone who's never competed and think i'm gonna i want to be mr olympia next\n11 \ntomorrow next year because it's not that easy so small goals \nsmall steps get your fire \nall right that's it for tonight it's \nlate i'm tired go to bed \nsee you tomorrow \n[Music] \nWould You Rather \nwould you rather this \nis too much pressure \nyeah so i didn't save enough questions and \nthey're all gone now we i've been dying trying to make weight we had to get us fancy clothes for my press conference and i just didn't save enough questions \nso now we're putting the pressure on melissa to wrap \nup this video and make the last few questions \nwould you rather never drink \nany get to never drink any water ever again \nor only be able to drink water ever again only build your water again really easy and drink nothing else nothing else yeah \npretty much all i drink when i'm not in prep i'll don't drink anything else ever unless i'm drinking and that's pretty rare \ni could go with a drinking alcohol what would you do i don't know because i'm \n[ __ ] addicted to coffee \nbut i also like drink so much water yeah that means you have to let go of pre-workout and salt too \ni just take it easily caffeine pills with water yeah that was a bad question for me \nwould you rather be able to speak every single human language in the entire world \nor be able to communicate with animals i'm trying to think very practically on\n12 \nthis like in my head i'm like every language and [ __ ] for like business opportunities and like \n[ __ ] like that but like if i could talk to animals i could just create my own business opportunity of like \nlike a [ __ ] my youtube channel \nimagine if i could communicate with animals on my youtube channel and like train them to do crazy [ __ ] and stuff i feel like that'd be and i'd be the \nonly one in the world in the universe the world \naliens included so probably animals can they talk back to me like i can \nunderstand them \nand i can speak their language yeah oh my god what poppy would think or doug doug would think nothing that would have been \ndoug would literally think nothing and then he'd look at you and be like oh hi i like you poppy would \nthink that we're all [ __ ] idiots \nprobably [ __ ] off with you \nyou're done do what i want bow down to me now \nbasically she'd be looking at her plate of food like hand feed me what are you waiting for \nand b would just like want like \nbe like i want to do this oh [ __ ] this dog [ __ ] this dog and then she's like oh my god i'm sorry mom i'm sorry mom i'm sorry \ni'm sorry about me hold me \nfeed me i'm hungry feed me all the dogs i'm hungry \nyeah are you eating yeah okay what how long are you gonna be \ni just finished okay why i'll just get ready to take my picture so we can get down \nor you can yell a question down if you have a question i don't have a question yeah i forgot to save enough would you\n13 \nrather not shower for a week or not brush your teeth for a week \nyeah but that would start feeling pretty [ __ ] nasty yeah \nlike if i'm working out every day yeah then yeah \ndefinitely \nreally yeah but i also don't really get like danky like you guys yeah you're not really sneaky \nrichest person in the world or the smartest person in the world \nsmartest if you're the smartest you just figure out a way to get rich anyway so who cares \nhe's the richest yeah but if i keep that money \nbut like also people who are that smart always are like \nyou know you lose something like you can't connect with other people you it's hard to socialize and you just like it's like you belittle everyone because you're too smart \nand if they don't know something you're just like are you dumb like i know everything and you don't even know that i don't think i've become that but a lot of smart really smart people are just socially awkward because they're just they know too much yeah but don't you think they might have like high \nintelligence but like their emotional intelligence is then stupid \nmaybe yeah that's true i don't know what's going on with brains \nyou'd have a lot going on with your brain if you're the smartest person in the world \noh would you rather live a peaceful existence \nwhere you had to worry where you never had to worry about the troubles of life or live a more \nnormal life full of risk and challenge risking challenge i feel like it'd be\n14 \nnice to feel like \npeaceful all the time but you wouldn't understand what peaceful meant after a while \nyou wouldn't you wouldn't be able to enjoy it \nthat's like saying if there was no sadness in this world \nat all you know no one would also be happy would all just be like neutral without hiding again yeah i guess if you never had a single stress how would you even know \nyou would like what piece is you would just be blah \nyou'd be like a blob yeah yin yang of the universe we need balance \nall right so that was our improvisation very on the spot mostly i think pulled up some questions \nwould you rather random [ __ ] on our laptop and just \njust a little nice little switch up to the little q a that we threw in there at the end \ngetting a little poochy late at night 9 30. \nit's tuesday monday monday monday one day a few more workouts a few more days and then it's all going down so we'll be documenting everything that i'm willing to document if i'm getting more lazy to be on camera \nbut until then i'm playing some zelda i'll see you guys in the next video you\n15 "

Morning Routine & Shoulder Day (Transcript) Compiled PDF ? 2025-11-01 \ndo I have abs GH cut [ __ ] debab that g cut yeah I'm Miss natti's liver King bro gotcha come on come on Chris come on two more free time Olympia Champion let's go [Applause] [Music] what is up YouTube I should be saying good morning YouTube we're going to be giving you guys a morning routine video right now we did last year people always like doing that stuff so I'm going to be telling you guys everything I do from when I wake up to I a little bit post breakfast I guess but pretty much wake up I try and get a liter of water in the morning CU I piss like a racehorse through the night usually lose like 6 lbs so I try and drink this in the morning brush my teeth clean my retainer put that all away and then I try and to away myself butt naked so I'm consistent cuz my clothes will all weigh a little bit different under 250 so we're good to go next upep I will come in here flip this light on and this is the garage where you guys have seen some dope pictures from Calvin I have a box set up right here with a shoe and this is my tripod and it's about there I stepped like a little bit under the light cuz this light is so hard harsh and then I do my posing right here not going to pose for you guys I give you guys a little quad Flex that's all you get but for now the POS is a secret do that and then I send the video to Honey with my weight pretty much every morning or at least every morning I actually POS and then normally a little lot of breath and like God damn open the garage for when I go do cardio come back in here and a little bit of Cafe Olay I just changed this up it's I was having raw burn this [ __ ] gets you lit up it has you himan only 150 Mig of caffeine which I love cuz I don't want to have too much caffeine but still makes you sweat and get you stemmed up but I'm kind of cutting that stuff out like 2.5 weeks AG as you guys saw from my f day eating I'm slowly picking away sweeteners that are like intense I'll still have like a tiny bit of my coffee if I want it but nothing quite that strong I guess you could say so I either torn these up way early before me she'll make a hot coffee sometimes but cold brew is also good cuz we're in Florida and after I POS in that garage I'm normally already a little bit sweaty and then to this I add been having these electrolyte samples again I piss through so much through the night that like I'm dehydrated in the morning obviously and these things are packed like there's a gram of sodium in here so I don't have nearly the whole thing a full one of these will ask me like in courtne like two or three drinks each all I do is sprinkle a little bit on like that it's chocolate flavored so if you're wondering why the [ __ ] putting electrolytes in there it's chocolate flavored and then I take corney's little fro there spin it up oh you're right it's thing it's kind of sad this stuff makes it easy anyway I could probably just Stir It stir it and we're good to go yeah normally I'd love to have some nut pods some like dairyfree sugar-free creamies and [ __ ] in there but obviously we're not having that right now so drink this super light chocolate taste but just gives a little flavor little electrolytes then I refill my water back up to the top grab my headphones and go start cardio so I'm just going to sip on my coffee and then I'll see you on the treadmill all right so these are my ugly ass cardio shoes have no I like to train in socks these are like the sock equivalent of a shoe almost there's like nothing to them no support super wide toe base right there so I can like my feet aren't crammed into a shoe and I have tried every which shoe Courtney just bought a new pair of as6 she tried New Balance all the [ __ ] I'm like yo just buy the barefoot shoes to new cardio your feet are not meant to be wrapped up in a tight squish like cushion shoe so this is what I rock for cardio and honestly it's helped my knees it's help my feet it's help my shins when I do a lot of cardio and I'm someone with really bad feet so that SVS a lot this is the chimo in the good old garage it's got a lot of buttons to start which is very annoying I have to look at all these fake happy faces staring at me on the pictures I typically start it incline 3% Speed 3 mph and take a T-shirt and the screen is like an iPad large and it's full brightness so I put a t-shirt over top two reasons brightest [ __ ] in my eyes in the morning second reason I don't want to see the time on it for as long as I can so I typically do this setting people always ask me this treadmill setting I typically do this and then I'll go up to a 6% incline and slowly in ramp my speed up to 3.4 3.5 mph and sometimes near the end I'll put up like 8 10% ink fine and really trying to like push through my glutes so that I'm walking I'm trying to squeeze my butt just to make sure I'm like getting the good old glute shredded also turn the fan on this thing is freaking hot in Florida some days and it gets brutal out here and then I just walk my ass out for about not about 45 minutes on the dot I get the [ __ ] off this thing in 45 minutes I'm not a cardio guy but I typically start headphones in I\nput on like a relaxing music and try and just like chill reflect sometimes I like what why why I'm drawing a bike right now Envision whatever the rest of my prep me going through Peak Week me backstage me getting on stage me doing this stuff and I like put myself Through the Motions like that and I kind of feel it all and experience it all and get myself like mentally prepared for it I don't do that a few time of the week sometimes I just sit here and think of like what's going on in my life reflect do like a a gratitude reflection random [ __ ] like that and then I'll go in check my emails reply to text blah BL blah blah I also forgot to mention when I go to sleep I put my phone on airplane mode at like I 9:00 at night so nothing can even come through I wake up nothing comes through no no notifications and it just stops my mind from having to think about anything until I'm on the treadmill and I choose to to get off airplane mode and check if I have anything going so if there like a stressful thing from work or an email or whatever I don't have to focus on it until I'm ready to focus on it and then I go through all that [ __ ] watch a show watch some YouTube kill time and then you'll see what happens after that so I'm going to crush this [ __ ] and enjoy it every second because who doesn't love cardio [Music] [Music] all right I can do that my absolute array of Health supplements currently take people probably going ask what I'm taking so I'm might as well just say as I'm going but I have K2 D3 kidney turmeric vitamin C a whole bunch of fish oils I know there's calories and fish oils but I've been having these every single day so my body is used to it take lipid the healthy cholesterol sodium bicarbonate this is actually supposed to be anti-cancerous want here but it also helps for kidneys and stuff it's kind of a Progressive Medical thing that good for your kidneys and then liver and heart he's calling me now this is breakfast that has to all be like 10 calories at least more than 10 calories there's like 10 omegas in there I do it every day if I had just added that in like a week out I add in like 100 calories from fish oils maybe that wouldn't be the best but my body e to it and I'm do wait doing it so we're doing it anyways just finished cardio 45 minutes wrapped it up honey called me I sent him videos and then he wanted to call me to go over a game plan now that we're like 2.5 weeks out stuff is changing very consistently he like do more cardio do less cardio post today instead of cardio eat this if it's chest day you know so fine tuning everything and change almost every day and luckily he talks a lot he can just rant on the phone so it's good when I'm on the treadmill because then I just can get through it and next thing I know it's like oh I've been walking for 45 minutes and we got a game plan and I'm ready to go and then sometimes I'm like con I'm rushing out the door I got to go man what is it but he's very technical and I mean we're 2.5 weeks up so I want technical I want everything locked in and even if sometimes coaches tell you to change stuff consistently they're really hot just to make you feel like you're doing more than than you are then that helps like if I'm like okay well if you told me to do this today and change that tomorrow like something's different every day just to kind of break up the monotony of the bodybuilding [ __ ] Groundhog Day sometimes it helps anyways just made my pancakes this morning I've been going back and forth in my morning routines between either making oats and eggs or blending it into pancakes I don't know why I just like switching it up sometimes I want to eat like two separate things that taste a little bit different sometimes I just want to eat a plate a thin watery egg white pancakes so today one of those days we're going to cook these pictures up and to Joy cuz I am freaking hungry right now [Music] [Music] these taste better than a hamburger in the offseason expect it it you starve yourself for 16 weeks eat these you'll enjoy it more than if you starve yourself for 16 weeks you'll eat dirt exactly it's but you get more enjoyment from it cuz you're deprived why deprivation is such a beautiful thing you rather get more joy from small things don't you rather have a burger instead no I rather earn something through deprivation but I wanted more have studio in the house today this is probably the epitome of how you don't want to live in prep cameras and lights on you but you're lucky I love you guys anyways final part is of my morning routine sometimes I cold tub briefly in the morning but lately I've been doing a Sonic cold tub later in the day so not toly morning routine but I've been stretching and rolling out a little bit I typically just roll out a little bit at the start just to like move some stuff through and then I stretch my my hips hip flexors a little bit just to get stuff like moving I feel like there's been like a trend lately of people being like foral doesn't do anything stretching doesn't do anything and there's been this trend of people like debunking everything that every everyone's ever done as a myth and saying like nothing works oh jeez having B but you know what anecdotally I have never stretched in the past and this year I've been stretching like five times a week in the morning my hips feel better my quads feel better my knees feel better I've been like less pain than I've been I can squat right now at 2 weeks out with no knee pain my stra sh Cuts everything and my legs are a little bit more Fuller a little bit deeper and when I get really like tight in my hip from doing so much\ncardio I actually start to feel like tired and exhausted it can even affect my digestion just like blood flow everything lymphatic drainage right babe yeah bab all that good stuff and it's helped me and anecdotally I feel better doing it so I'm going to continue to do it but I typically just roll through my quads a little bit like I said get stuff going and then I go over in my little carpet stretch area over there and stretch which I'll show you in a [Music] minute all right run through this a little quick show you guys I'm so Calvin and have to watch me stretch for 20 minutes but huge thing hip flexers tight on everyone definitely tight on me I like to find something that's like yay high put my foot on it lean forward like this and I'll like thrust my hips forward flex my glute of the foot that's up and kind of push through with my hip like a pelvic tilt pushing forward and you really feel like a tight stretch in here and I'll just kind of like move around like that sometimes I lean back I put my arm behind me and I'll feel it like all the way up here like this sometimes I sit into it a little bit deeper just let it pull in there and you just kind of find whatever spot feels really tight and when it hits I just hold that and I mean sometimes I'll literally like get into that part I'm watching a show doing something on my phone and I'll just sit there in that position for like a minute or something just really let it open up and I don't do this right before I train and do it like early in the morning and then I'm like 4 hours later I'm working out so if I'm doing legs or anything like that it's not like overly loose and I also do my hips glutes just sitting like this across my underneath me and this is when it always cracks through my hips and feels so good to release but I literally same kind of thing just push till you feel where you want to feel this is where I get my hip up in the hip chop socket joint in there loosen up a lot I feel it my glutes too especially if I lean forward like that damn I feel so good it really gets that [ __ ] out like that after that oh damn do a little bit of hamstering and stuff just like open my legs wide this is kind of my adductor groins too I try and just like crawl myself forward and like reach a few times and I push my feet out like this so that my toes are pointing outwards of my body not in and you feel that pull a little bit deeper in your groin here and you pull in there next for whatever reason a million ways to stretch every part of your body you literally have to figure out which way is best for you I like just sitting on a knee and I kind of have a slight Bend in my in my knee right here and this is for my hamstring and I can like rotate a little bit and pull my outer hamstring I can come in a little bit and get on my inner there and just just feel like you always just got to feel your body wherever you need it pull from that position sit in it when your body gets comfortable in there push a little bit deeper into it breathe through all your stretches and roll with it these are the main ones that I do sometimes I'll like line on my back pull my knees to my chest roll the side all that kind of good stuff but these are the main literal for that I do because my hips hamstring glutes and quad hip flexors are the tightest things on my body some days I'll stretch my lats just simply by like starting on something like this and pulling one at a time and just rolling through whatever I feel like I need to typically have a podcast on or even a show I'll set up over there and watch it and I do this for like 20 minutes max super easy and honestly some days if I'm like really tired and I feel exhausted beat up I'm just like oh [ __ ] this day after this I actually have more energy just like blood flow moving through your body letting the energy kind of flow through your body and it's a great way to start the day so you don't feel like a complete ass even though I still do anyways right now cuz I'm two weeks out so that's pretty much it for my morning routine I'll probably I take a cold shower after cold there's no real cold water the showers in Florida sadly but it is what it is I make it as cold as I can sometimes I dip in the cold tub like I said if I do in the morning it's only like 2 or 3 minutes typically do it longer later in the day with a sauna especially on rest days and it's about it probably not going to show you me getting in the shower cuz Kevin's seen enough of me naked more retanning at the oia kind of sus and you guys are very sus so I don't want to show you that so thank you guys for watching and I don't know what we're training after this but see you at the gym Jesus all right what's going on guys shoulder day I filming shoulders in a minute but I'm like 50 g carved deep right now and I'm feeling it warming up it's just literally trying to get energy moving through my body so I can actually feel my muscles and functioning pretty much refraining from 90% of free weights at least with like compound movements so I warm up the [ __ ] under of my shoulder I've done like four sets so far like 10 reps on this machine here about to get started on the working sets then we're going to move through some machine presses maybe some dumbbell raises and get through this beautiful shoulder workout because it's also one of those days where I have the worst [ __ ] protein farts so I tried to get them all out before I came here cuz no one wants that of the gym to hold it in but it's part of prep sadly and need a private gym for that soul purpose but I'll be holding it in cuz I don't want to [ __ ] embarrass myself in front of anyone here luckily it's a dead gym Calvin might be the one suffering [Music] [Music] B my knee in there had to pick\nmy legs up and walk right now but warm-ups lately honestly been doing a little bit more well you normally like 3 to four serve my energy but right now I'm really trying to get my blood moving flowing and I'm not hitting any PR they're doing really heavy sets right now so I'm trying to like burn calories blood flow warm up properly not hurt myself it's easier to hurt yourself the dryer Le get too so taking a slow just trying to not lose all my size [Music] well you don't check your phone you're going to work out honey texted me he's like how many carb meals do you have left today I was like just one he's like okay cut all your carbs I was like sick I guess I'm having zucchini and fish post workout a dream come true no more carbs for the rest of the day time to get [ __ ] shredded boys this is two weeks out and time to suffer time to deplete suffer and just nap and work out and survive so it's game time [Music] [Music] track my water on these liter water bottles I just like strike on them but it makes me drink more water cuz I'm tracking for whatever reason I have to piss all the time in the only bathroom in the opposite corner of the gym has the machines I'm just like too L to walk over there I hold my piss half the workout there piss herself so P show start wearing diaper yeah bum diapers come up new line of bum pull-ups that you wear at the gym so you don't have to go pee [Music] you think you need you [Music] the one thing about being good or good Jesus being weak right now is I can use this machine I [ __ ] love this machine but it's just way too light there's Flex Fitness shoulder presses that have flight loaded this one's pin loed and that's full stack right there and I just control the way and push typically my offseason I can't use it but I'm weak right now I don't feel like loading up bunch of plates such in truck out there and I was like what the [ __ ] uh yeah that's all I got to say nice to be weak for this one reason [Music] that's [Music] [Music] you [Music] [Music] free weights all I'm doing is accessories really right now so I did three sets shoulder press three sets pin load of shoulder press now I'm going to do probably two sets laterals two sets front raises move on with some re dels probably going to be it for shoulders but I want to give a shout out to flex to for the T-shirt he just randomly sent me a box with some dragon lir t-shirts and then this one which is like a custom cut and sew shirt and it's like a little bit longer no hate on flex but this would be an absolute dress on you but I like it cuz I love long kind of oversized t-shirts so I don't know if he's building a brand or not but if he is stay tuned cuz I got a shirt in the mail it doesn't safe Dragon there or Flex on so thanks Flex love you see you in a week [Music] [Music] [Music] skinny [ __ ] don't be skinny [ __ ] or # skinny [ __ ] big difference in your verbage but I'm a skinny [ __ ] I [Music] [Music] ch [Music] I going to tweak it for my last set [Music] either what I call hone calls the [ __ ] slap redel flies do with the best with a metal cable a metal handle so it locks your wrist in position instead of pulling like this which I'm doing for the next exercise you kind of do like a [ __ ] slap motion and I I like do it high pulling down a little bit I feel it more into my like mid rear Dell rather than into my traps at all feels good I don't know whatever you get your best mod connection with rear Dells is one of those finicky things you got to play with it feels good to me so give it a shot thank you yeah thank you sadly this gym only has one PE deck so I'm just waiting to do reverse flies on that but I was going to wrap up today with a little bit of triceps and I don't feel like waiting doing nothing so finishing not finishing replacing my finisher or whatever I don't know what I'm saying doing these cable crossover things been doing these this prep feel very good on my triceps isolated movement I hit my tricep a little bit through shoulders so I just kind of Polish them off a little bit here cuz I'm not going to be training arms for 3 days so I figured might as well get a little extra in there and then I think whenever I think this gu done on the back deck I'm going to seal that finish there long as someone else doesn't take it from me little ABS little cardio go home eat zero carbs thanks to honey do it all again tomorrow this is part of those workouts where I'm just like dying but I'm going to make Calin film this because people say I don't do abs so Calvin no every time I go to train ABS he just leaves the gym and everyone's like you train ABS Chris I'm like no Calvin just doesn't like filming to do abs you don't do abs okay so I don't do abs very intense but this is the first year I've actually trained abs and I know I have proof because I don't cramp I used to do three four five reps and just cramp about I couldn't do anymore now I can do three four five sets and not die so the Plus for me I don't know if it's going to translate on stage they look that different right now have a little bit better abdominal control but I don't do any like weighted crunches heavy machinery none of that [ __ ] I was doing more like body weight crunches and like leg lifts and different variations throughout my prep but now that I'm at the end and I'm honestly just dead at the end of my work I just do straight leg raises into knee tuck and do like four five sets nothing crazy almost failure not quite and then call it a day that's all it takes one set a year no I do that I try and get 10 straight leg 10 knee tuck my first set or so and then the rep slowly dwindle down I don't get any body pumped right now not I'm going to pump anywhere so depleted and\nmy abs get pumped I don't know why it's not a good feeling it's not what you want but hopefully have a better midsection on stage this year have you ever bent over and just like your top AB cramps bro I [ __ ] just I have to stand like this and just lean backwards slightly and or otherwise they all cramp it looks in like a lock it looks like I have a hernia like sticks out cuz the whole pack like contraction sticks out miserable [Music] is do I have abs GH got [ __ ] Deb Flex that GH cut yeah I'm Miss natti's liver King bro gotcha back on the St give me wrap on this workout though hope you guys enjoyed my morning routine my morning ritual my shoulder day my actually training AB believe it or not you seen it here first Chris might have a sixpack on stage this year maybe even a five and a half pack if he's lucky but that's going to be wrap on today's workout two weeks out like I just [ __ ] told you guys honey pulling the food out in the cardio time to suffer only really 12 days until I weigh in 11 days until I weigh in so I got to be sub 240 it's still some waight to lose and weigh-ins this year they move them they're typically in the morning on Thursday they're actually at late at night now on Wednesday so that means I have to wait under 2:40 at like 8:00 p.m. at night which is [ __ ] hard for me so I better be [ __ ] shredded that's all I got to say that's all I got to say though for real thank you guys for watching love you guys thank you for joining me on this beautiful journey of getting shredded enjoying the journey enjoying the process having fun with it and it's almost all over so till next time goodbye"

Transcript Generated on 2025-11-01 08:13 \nlook at that you're gonna eat it and you're gonna love it got my blue light glasses on [Music] come on come on Chris come on two more [Music] [Applause] [Music] what is up YouTube Welcome to full day of eating 2.4 weeks out Edition I think under 250 pounds now so we're in a good spot definitely gonna make wait over two weeks to lose like eight pounds or so it's easy I've done much worse in the past so I'm gonna be taking these through everything I'm eating right now at this point and I think it's cool because last year to get the conditioning I am I was eating a lot less so I'll show you guys I will pull up what I ate last three calories I think it's 15 1600 calories around now and then we'll see what I'm eating today because I haven't fully calculated it because honey typically goes by carbs and fats from carbs and fat sources so yeah we're gonna get to it but I'm gonna be making some oats I'm very indecisive with flavoring right now so I'm going to be making some scoop of cooking cream half a scoop of vanilla in the cookie because you know life gets boring too you gotta push things up cooking it on the sofa get the best way to do it that's too much so we get 80 grams of oatmeal in the morning which is a pretty hefty amount for me and the path it's going down to like 40 50 ish so I'm not complaining about this the sun perfected the art of cooking these things prep mode because I like chewy oats of minimal water according to clean and cooking those but in prep I want more volume so I add more water so hopefully I don't [ __ ] this up for the video I've literally thrown oats out twice in a row before in the garbage because I'm not wasting calories on shitty oats in prep the right Brandon it's the wrong burner turn the wrong burner on every morning so I'm going to let that heat up a little bit when it's a little bit warm I'm going to add the protein in and then mix it up lower the heat and keep mixing hopefully it fluffs up a little bit and then I'm going to cook my eggs when when they're a little closer to ready because I don't want my eggs to get cold so first I'm going to make my little drink concoction and I'll show you guys just what that is sugar is available at Vitamin Shoppe all right so this is far from exciting but just for a little bit of a gut and digestion Health do one scoop of glutamine every morning I used to put this in my pancakes or Shake but I don't want to put it myself it's going to be kind of weird next I do a equivalent of teaspoon of psyllium whole husk fiber it's a soluble fiber just to help me move stuff along go to the bathroom every single day calendar we also straight up I'll save this we have a revive fiber and it tastes absolutely amazing but I'm trying to avoid excess sweetener right now and there's a little bit of sweetener in it because it tastes so good this is unflavored it tastes like ass and it's super grainy and it's kind of honestly disgusting but it is what it is right now and then I do a scoop of betaine and this can help with inflammation markers if you get blood work done and your homocysteine is high so this is something that can help with that so it's just literal pure betane anhydrous and that's pretty much the extent of that so I'm gonna mix this up with a spoon I don't know if you can see a grainy that is that's why this fiber is nasty but not blend and that's why you don't put it in shakes or anything it's just not dirt might just be dirt but my grandma said dirt's good for the immune system I'll be taking fiber you want to make sure you're drinking a lot of water otherwise it can have the wrong if I can actually like constipate you but I'm drinking like two gallons plus with water a day right now so I'm good so if you're adding more fiber to your diet make sure you're drinking a little bit more water too so this is heating up for a little little kick you know a little something different I used to be obsessed with chocolate oats in the morning I don't know this year I'm a vanilla even my ice creams I would make in later in the day I'm gonna need the vanilla so maybe I'm maturing to a boring vanilla adult the [ __ ] just wasted a full gram folks I thought it's getting cooked eggs sitting spray we're going hardcore it's right there it's empty portion tank could have been a little hotter we'll see how this works out foreign part you just gotta wait [Music] [Music] it's a lot of scraps no what happened to run out of cooking spray oh damn I almost broke that yolk that yolk though rookie pan beautiful yolk take what you can get you should get a hex Cloud plan a what hex clad and Courtney just ordered do you see if Jared back in the garage I don't even know how much pans and stuff so let's see if those are any better I just got a hex Cloud for my place I've never heard of that the Gordon Ramsay uses them there was a commercial for Gotham steel pans now I got hooked into buying one they were the worst thing it ever bought lasted a week it was like an infomercial back in the day oh a dumbass got cut I like the [ __ ] uh like with the Flex Seal kind of stuff plans sir all right so here's the Final Touch I've been I think I mentioned my last video but I'm actually measuring my sodium last year I [ __ ] the bed cut sodium too early wasn't sure how much I was eating it just wasn't tracking properly so this year not making that\nsame mistake and in the morning I do 2 8 of a teaspoon on breakfast and then every other meal I do 1 8 of a teaspoon of this plus I get a little bit from my mustard or pre-workout or other supplements I take to have sodium in it so I'm at least being consistent right now I know what I'm getting them if I have to taper down taper up make weight when we pull carbs whatever it may be we know just what to do so there you have it beautiful breakfast they want you to calculate it all right so beautiful not so beautiful but everything can safety right now Donald product 590 calories from this um don't have to be the macros because I don't know but there's 22 plus 53 grams of protein from protein sources not including notes and that's breakfast 590 calories ready to go down I'm hungry so I'm gonna eat [Music] [Music] [Music] all right so meal number two fully I was trying to lie down didn't fall asleep very tired slept like poo last night but I could eat some white fish right now so life is beautiful this meal consists of we got new cutlery all washed some beautiful new Forks this meal will consist of 200 grams of fresh Atlantic Cod I don't need tilapia because that's bad for you not bad for you it's not optimal fish to eat wow how much is left there's a 100 2011. she's on my diet today so 201 grams of fresh Atlantic Cod and then I have 150 gram of rice a lot of people in my last video it's completely unrelated they're asking what the sushi maker is it's called or sushi cheese uh rice maker it's called zoji rushi I got it on Amazon but it stays hot like this I feel like it's more like Asian culture to keep your eyes out warm all the time or just like ready to rock David Lane actually put me under this thing it's pretty clutch you just throw it in there hit start and it stays warm for ever and it tells you how long it stays warm for so I keep it in there sometimes for like four days I've been eating it all year and I haven't died yet so it is what it is I got 150 grams of white rice and then I instacarted a bunch of um shredded lettuce just shredded lettuce gets you shredded but it hasn't come in yet but I got a bunch of asparagus here sprinkle that on top nice and crispy because crispy vegetables are a goat vegetable I'm not like a half cooked al dante vegetable kind of guy I like my [ __ ] crispy I like it a little black but not too black so I'm not getting too many carcinogens and then the really appetizing looking melee yeah delicious so it looks like you just put grass in here maybe a dip maybe I did keep that up and while that is heating up I will let you know the calories because I'm doing that this time all right so that meal comes to 358 calories from the Cod I'm getting approximately 35 40 grams of protein rice is coming up to about 43 grams of carbs from that bad boy and that's a little baby meal to say the absolute least 1254 she's not gonna make it [Music] so there it is looks like absolute trash but you'd be surprised how good this Cod actually tastes to me right now normally it's bringing moisturred lettuce on there for a little bit of volume but um for now we'll stick with some Sriracha because one of the goat condiments that we've ever made there you have it deal number two shredded for the Olympia delicious all right here we go in the world's most boring full day of eating around a hundred meal number three it's gonna be my pre-workout meal sadly instant car failed on me and they had no shredded lettuce so I had to shred my own lettuce this head of iceberg lettuce I think that is I don't even know but the girls liked on me she said there's my shredded lettuce so you're not gonna get shredded bro I said that's not cool bro I'm gonna get shredded so that's what we got upset but I have 175 grams of rice this time pre-workout it's a tiny bit more than my last meal and then I'm having turkey either have turkey or chicken breast in this meal turkey is absolutely nothing on it but it's 98 lean two percent fat turkey I guess I could be getting 99 but I'm not that hardcore I don't want it to be that dry it's 180 grams turkey and then zucchini zucchini was like the most easily digestible low calorie but vegetables that was ever made so one of my go-to's during the crap especially before the gym I know that just turkey really easy even easier than fish rice is nothing it's lettuce is not zucchini nothing so I go to the gym and my stomach feels empty feels good because when you're I have bad digestion you don't feel good you're just like your energy is low on you it's not good it's no bueno so I'm gonna Heat this up add my shredded lettuce and then a little salt on and then a little mustard get to the gym [Music] there you have it beautiful clean delicious crunchy you know this comes out to about 420 calories it's always sad when you're a meal for me is under 500 calories but pretty much all of them except breakfast are right now so it's gonna be it gonna put this down caffeine with me some pre-workout try to wake my ass up to the gym train some arms and then I'll see you guys for post workout shake or meal number four depending how I feel after the gym foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] maybe next year for prep instead of getting ground Bryce bison you can just go hunt for it and Venison and stuff and and tilapia or sorry Cod bow and arrow on the spear fishing and bow and arrow hump bison the bow salmon 1883. you should reach out to Steve rinella and see if he'll collab Netflix Club I said I don't know who that is meat eater on Netflix yeah you'll probably get canceled right [Music] [Music] now you can use the spatula right oh that's the book them one at a time make sure both sides get crispy these Chopsticks because then you'll scratch the pan I'm not touching\nthe pan stabbing it turning it over it's not taking your cooking skills that's for sure foreign post-workout meal same [ __ ] you know you've got to get real bored here I got 180 grams of ground turkey we got some shredded lettuce by shredded by yours truly I got some zucchini fried up and 150 grams of white sweet jasmine rice I'm gonna mix up some sriracha and some mustard to make some spicy mustard and Crush that down somebody did want to point out though in some random tips that I've been doing a little bit very tiny little differences I've been doing this here though that helped that honey kind of like just like you know sprinkling these little 0.1 percent extra on so that they add up to another percent or two breakfast you saw I was typically well do my cardio maybe stretch maybe chill maybe shower do all this stuff and then eat breakfast now it's like I get off the treadmill I come in and I eat breakfast so we eat as soon as possible because I don't want to be in um that word again catabolic catabolic for that long and I want to just get my metabolism to go and get my digestion going early in the morning so that my meals are as spread out as possible and then I can eat my meals earlier in the day and then spread my meals out also post workout instead of having a shake and postponing my meal and not having any carbs I've been having my last carb meal immediately after I dream before I come home and just have this meal no showering again just eat it really quick and then I go shower and then I have my shake afterwards and just getting the carbs in post-workout help my body utilize them a little bit better when I need them and you know tiny little things that just allow my meals to be spread out more whereas I've mentioned before in the past I used to eat all my meals in like a seven hour period in the day my metabolism being able to slow down my energy was a lot worse and I mean calculated at the end of the day now but I think I'm eating around 0.1 2200 calories at the moment and last year when I was in this condition was lighter and I was eating like 1600 calories so 500 calories is a big difference that's like what is that like 25 or something which is a [ __ ] lot so and you know I notice it I feel it I'm exhausted but mine is at least a little bit better and you know a little bit more food is just always a good thing the more you can eat while getting lean is the best for a bodybuilder because you means you have more muscle you're utilizing it better and everything's just running a little bit more optimally so these are the tiny little things just kind of like adding point one percent point one percent point one percent and if you do enough of them you gain a percent and you're that much better and when you're at the Olympia level all of us are [ __ ] the best of the best of what we do so we gotta kind of inch forward in every single way we can so that's about that though so I'm hungry I'm gonna eat this so see you for the next meal or my [ __ ] [Music] [Music] foreign this is my first time trying this to this extent of planning you could say but I just just finished that last meal you saw me so and now I'm gonna make my shake to like a little ice cream thing and then I'm gonna put it in the freezer and leave it in there for like a little bit probably gonna forget about it and I'll probably eat it for now it'd probably be too hard and I'm probably not gonna really eat it but I'm gonna try and remember to stir it and see if I can make it like a little bit more of a frozen ice cream of sort so ice from the fridge water once glutamine again I have that morning and night and then Cinnamon Crunch cereal I don't know what's going on with this protein but this has been my favorite flavor of this prep to drink as like a smoothie or ice cream just with water it's very delicious so I haven't even tried it in oats actually but I've just been having it in my ice creams after so it's been satisfying I love CVS am I allowed CVS yeah yeah but I try I'm trying not to have too much you should make like a root beer float how much artificial [ __ ] right now avoiding what I can water and pre-workout and protein and I always put too little water in it doesn't blend it's like [Music] all right it literally sounds like a [ __ ] saw blade table somehow it lasted a year of me doing this [ __ ] so shout out to NutriBullet the thing actually broke from me doing that because the injured overheats because it's working so hard and it broke and then I put it in my drawer for like a month and I took it back out and kept working so awesome in fact it was a little too much water dumped too easily that's pretty good now we're gonna see this in the freezer I'll see you guys in an hour foreign I actually am so annoyed that you're just like playing this part that you wouldn't love that because like you dude that's you are someone who eats weird [ __ ] always yeah but that's just I'm like I don't know I just can't you're gonna eat it and you're gonna love it this is the final product of the shake top gets a little Frozen a little bite almost like real ice cream and that's that I'm gonna put this down get my blue light glasses on to look really cool we're gonna watch your show and protecting my eyes before bed so I can rest sleep easy because biohacking right babe yeah but yeah this is it we're gonna watch 1883 we're gonna relive our Red Dead Redemption day through this TV show and see you guys for my last meal welcome to the final meal of the day aka the saddest thing you'll ever see it's not that bad it's kind of depressing but it is what it is pretty pretty bad like lunchable size but it's 180 grams of turkey combined chicken because I didn't have enough of either so I mixed what I had left in the\nfridge a little bit of zucchini That's All She Wrote so this is gonna be a wrap on today's full day of eating 2.5 weeks yeah how many days away are we made 16. fridge says 16's got to be 16. so get down to it I don't know if my food's gonna have to get lower than this my weight's still slowly dropping but I will keep you guys in tune if it does I'm hoping it doesn't but I probably will just to make weight because I'm still like eight pounds over my limit right now so working on getting down there very much in the shape of where I need to be right now for two and a half weeks out but I can always be later and again gotta make that weight so anyways I'm gonna go over what the macros are for this I'm at this is a very approximate I don't trust my fitness pal at all but that's what I'm using the track yet total calories is 2177 calories 199 grams of carbs 18 grams of fat and 284 grams of protein so nothing crazy nothing wild but enough to get the job done so I'm gonna eat this finish the show and probably put a little mustard on this because it's a little dry go to bed wake up do it

    "text": "Full Day of Eating & Leg Day ? Transcript Created: 2025-11-05 ? File naming rule applied: YYYY-MM-DD-(name) \nThis is the most hilarious company ever. \nThis is that Brian Johnson guys company. \nThe guy wants to live forever. On the \nback it says Brian Johnson is the most \nmeasured person in history and a \nprofessional rejuvenation athlete. I \nkind of want to be a professional \nrejuvenation athlete. Maybe that'll be \nmy next sport to join. \n[Music] \nWhat is up, YouTube? Got to whisper \nright now cuz the baby is still \nsleeping. It's 7:00 a.m. It's leg day. \nEarly morning workout, full day of \neating. It's been a while since I've \ndone one of these, but going to jump \ninto it because we got to get to the gym \nMaking Breakfast \nand get moving. My breakfast has been \nbetween a smoothie or what I'm doing \ntoday, which is steak and nut butter. I \ndid like a food allergy test and I was \nallergic to um almonds, cashews, which \nare my favorite types of nut butters. \nPeanuts a little bit. that they weren't \nbad, but macadamia is not at all. So, I \nhave this macadamia nut butter. Actually \ntastes fire. And I just cooked this up \non a pan in butter, more fat, whatnot. \nWe're ready to roll. Since working with \nJustin, I never liked having carbs in \nthe morning, but I didn't know why. But \nnow understanding the whole like if you \neat a bunch of carbs in the morning, \nyou're spiking an insulin response, \nwhich sucks a bunch \nof amino acids thoroughly. All the amino \nacids in your muscle except tryptophan. \nTryptophan is a precursor for serotonin.\nSerotonin makes you like tired and chill and like lofty. Not really good right before a workout. So if you have like a highfat, zero to low carb breakfast, you're more likely to keep tyrosine in your blood, which is the precursor for dopamine and you're ready to be motivated, drive, go kick ass in the gym. So no carbs for breakfast, which is sad cuz I love pancakes and waffles, but it is what it is. We cook everything now in like butter or beef tallow. I'm not dieting, so I don't really care about calories anymore. So, I literally just have steak prepped pretty much every day. Take it out in the morning, fry it up in some butter, add some almond butter or macadamia nut butter, and then rock and roll. All right, so there's breakfast. This is my like horribly ugly meal, but honestly, tastes fire. \nActually going to add salt to \nit. That's the other crucial thing in the morning when I wake up. I have this Yeti sitting in my bathroom and I put salt in it the night before. So, I drink like a liter before I train with a bunch of salt, salt the [ __ ] in my meal, some electrolytes in my thing, my \npre-workout, then I'm hydrated, ready to rock. So, I like to at least get like an hour and a half plus like over a liter of water in me plus electrolytes before I train. \n[Music] \nYou be dieting at all into the wedding? I want to be. My nutrition was pretty bad for a while cuz I wasn't competing. Yeah, I was eating like three times a day maybe. I'm trying to eat more now to ramp up my metabolism and my body's burning. So, I want to do that for like a couple weeks just to make sure I'm\nactually in a good place to start a diet. And then I want to cut down before the wedding a little bit. Strictly just so my face looks good though. Like I don't really care. But then when I get back from that trip, game on. I'm trying to get jacked as \n[ __ ] All right, so final breakfast. put Meal 1 \nit into the Chusty Standard app, go to macro tracking. Sick update coming for us soon. That's going to make my life easier. But this meal comes out to 480 calories, 40 g of protein, 32 g of fat, 4 g of carbs. So, obviously very fat dominant. Not a lot of calories, but I had enough carbs the night before. Had some toast and butter before bed. So, we're locked in. Glycogen stores are full. Just getting a little bit of \nnutrient fat in me right now to get me through this workout. tastes \nsurprisingly good putting like a nut butter on steak, too, with \nbutter. So, oh, it's some pre-workout after this. I go train legs. All right, Preworkout \nso I did a clearing of the supplements here and here cuz I had way too many and now I'm like wishing I had more flavors. So, that's my fault. I go between \nessential and thage every day. My typical go-to recently is one scoop of Thavage cuz I'm being a little [ __ ] essentially. If I train later in the \nday, I double scoop it. But since I cut caffeine out for a while, my like \ncaffeine receptors were a lot more efficient, I guess. I don't know the proper terminology, but I was able to lock in with this. So, technically, it's built to be two scoops, but it's also packed enough that one scoop is good\nenough for what you need. So, I take some of that. Some days I take an extra Cognizant, a triple dose of Cognizant for the day. So, one scoop beverage, a little bit of cotton in, and we're ready to rock for the workout. It's funny. If I don't take pre-workout in the \nmorning, if I eat carbs and then have like a coffee and then go to the gym, I'm pretty like, but if I don't eat \ncarbs, have a pre-workout, even maybe a little bit of neutropics, which we're actually making a sick neutropic for, but do that, I'm like locked in at the gym way more efficiently. So, \nThat's all I got to say. Proof is in the park. We're going to take this, go to the gym, keep waking up on the way \nthere, and show you guys what my new leg workout was like. Actually, it's a lie. I'm not doing that in this video, so pretend I didn't say \n[Music] \nthat. All \nPost Workout \nright, so we just wrapped up the \nworkout. Not going to include the workout on the full day of eating \nbecause it's a full day of eating. So, but we did film it. But post-workout nutrition, I guess backtracking, intra workout nutrition, I had like 40 3540 g of carbs, bunch of electrolytes, and some E one scoop of EAS, which is like 8 g of amino acids in there. And then post-workout, typically my day looks like the breakfast I showed you train. And then I do two scoops of goated dark chocolate protein. The flavor I will never get sick of because I've had this probably 5,000 bottles of this in my lifetime. You got to do a little extra for good luck cuz you never know. I try\nto get at least 50 g of protein in from that. And then I run out the door with a cadence bar. This is my current go-to. The carbs I have post-workout kind of vary depending what I have access to. But we got a couple boxes these here. So this is 40 g of carbs. And this first ingredient in here is rice crisps. So pretty much like eating rice, \nessentially rice and protein. Um, and there's a bunch of sodium in there, too. So, I got to run, shower, then have a meeting, and then I'll have lunch \ntypically like around noon. So, 50 g of protein, 40 g of carbs post-workout. And I also, I think I talked about this in my last video. I've been just like \nadding amino acids in pills cuz why not? I feel like more aminos, more protein sensitized. They that one study that came out that everyone was talking about that they did a study on like 30 to 100 grams of protein ingested at a one time and even at 100 g it had a higher increase of protein thin stats in the body. I cannot say that word lisp. Wow. Had a higher percentage of whatever you know the word compared to 30 g. So there was no upper limit in the study. I'm a bodybuilder at 250 lbs. So bring me all the amos I can get. That's it. I got a jet. I'll see you guys at \n[Music] \nlunch. All right, \nMeal 2 \nhere's meal number two technically, but also protein shake. I got sweet potato here, chicken, and green beans. We're working on our gut diversity here. Trying not to eat just chicken and rice every day. Threw in some green beans and some sweet potato. I have 200 g of chicken breast, 180 g of sweet potato,\nand I don't know how many green beans. So, it's like 550 calories, 60 g of \nprotein, 15 g of fat, 36 g of carbs. This is typically my lunch. There's a lot of stuff going on. Bunch of people in town and we're having a meeting in my office. So, last month, maybe like 10 times, I've actually gone up on the roof and like left my phone behind and just sat in the sunlight and gotten some fresh air cuz I feel like I just like \nget cooped up in here all day. And it's kind of nice enjoying my food up there. And we were talking before this too, like your body digests food so much better when you're in like a relaxed, calm state. Whereas before, and I still do this a lot, but I would just like get a meal, go in there and have like a Zoom call or to do something and just like be like back and forth eating instead of actually like sitting down and enjoying and eating your food, letting your body rest and digest and all the good stuff. And you actually make efficiently make more hydrochloric acid so your body can actually digest food, specifically high amounts of protein. A lot of people have [ __ ] their stomach up, bodybuilders, by eating a [ __ ] ton of protein in a stressful state and can't digest it. So, do as they say, not as they do. But this is meal number two, plus a shake. [Music] \n2.5 stop. All \n[Music] \nMeal 3 \nright. So, this \nis meal number three. This is I mean, first of all, we're on the roof, so I \nshould probably I guess I already talked about that, but this is where I come sometimes for meal because we're trapped\ninside an office and I want some fresh air and some sunlight. Normally, the sun's right about there at noon, so I sit here cuz this is the one spot with no rust right there. And I just sit and chill. And I try not to look at my phone and get some energy from the sunlight. Get a nice little tan, fresh air, \ndecompress from a day stuck in an old office. But there's a meal. I can't \nremember what the rice is in it. \nHonestly, I think it's 160 g of rice and 180 g of chicken from Meafit with their buffalo sauce, which is really good, but also really spicy. I typically have like 10 to 15 frozen meals in my freezer at all time for me fit that I try and like restock and then I try and keep a couple in the fridge thawed ready to go at any time. So on days like today where I'm training legs and I'm trying to rebuild my metabolism again I'm bring two meals to work for a while I was only bringing one. So if I had like a shake in the morning and then after a workout maybe to have another shake and then I'd only bring one meal to work. I'd barely be eating by the time I got home if it like six o'clock. So I'm trying to bring two meals now. eat in the morning and then by like 2 3 p.m. I'm already three meals in a shake deep. So that's what I'm using Megapit for because cooking that many meals in a week is no bueno. And we have a child now. So Courtney's not just taking care of me as a baby anymore. She got to take care of a real baby. So one meal a day cooked by me, one meal a day cooked by Mega Fit and we're good to go. And I really do believe in rebuilding metabolism by eating more meals frequent fre more smaller meals more frequently throughout the day instead of going long\nperiods of time without eating and eating like a huge meal at the end of the day. Being able to spread them out, your body gets used to constantly getting food and nutrients so it doesn't need to hold on to it. So your \nmetabolism speeds up, thyroid gets f flying, you get more energy, and you can eat more. So when I start dieting, I can eat higher calories and burn more fat without having to starve myself as much. So that's the goal. Meal number three. Not very exciting, but the bodybuilder will never die in me eating chicken rice. \n[Music] \nWellness Drink \nI do that every time. All right, so I just got home. I have another call at it's like 6, so I'm making myself a little beverage. Courtney's like the queen of making these drinks. I dabble every now and then. They don't make them quite like her, but just like health and wellness kind of energy, hydration type good stuff. \nSo, put some water in here. And then K is famous for her matcha drinks. So, she's got the bougie ceremonial grade Japanese matcha. There's a little bit of caffeine in this, but barely a little \nbit. I normally wouldn't have a lot of caffeine this late, but you can handle a little bit from little green tea like \nmatcha. It's also one of the most \npowerful antioxidants ever. It's like 50 times more antioxidants in it than in blueberries. So, super fire. Then mix it with a little bit of this saffron \npowder. Saffron is supposed to be this like all \nnatural, don't quote me on this because I'm feeling like someone else is quoting\nsmarter than me, but the dude called it like an allnatural SSRI. Obviously, it's not quite as powerful as an SSRI, but it's like a calming mood booster. Kind of like Zen. Helps me kind of chill out. Then a little bit of collagen \nbecause I'm injured. Trying to rebuild my tendon strength and my gut health. So then go into the \npantry. Do a scoop of this sun fiber. This fiber is like the most easily \ndigestible to soluble fiber. It's also great for trying to help lower \ncholesterol and just super easy on your gut to digest and some creine. If I have a smoothie in the morning, I'll \ntypically put that in this and that or I used to have some in my gym but the bottle right now. So, I'm adding like green at night right \nnow. But I put in this right \nnow. Ice comes last. If you mix it too early, it gets like clumpy and powdery around the ice and you're \nscrewed. But just like that, I got a nice little antioxidant matcha mood boosting saffron gut healing fiber gain creatine drink. How's that for our marketing? Should be \ngood. The key is Japanese ceremonial Afternoon Snack \ngrade matcha. You get that [ __ ] from America or other places where they make it. Tastes like grass. You got to get the good stuff. On top of that, you got to eat this raw bar. I was trying not to eat these every day, but we ordered like six boxes of them. They're so good. But it's a super clean bar. They're \ndifferent types of nuts. This one's a peanut butter base. Some of them are sunflower, um, cashew butter, different things, but I'm trying to avoid those.\nSo, this the peanut butter I get in for the day. 20 g of protein, 290 calories. Good amount of fat, but it tastes great. I'm going to have my drink. I'm going have my \nbar. Got on this call and we'll have a real meal \nlike an hour and a \nhalf. Best clock in the world. \n[Music] \nThis is a meal that varies every single day depending sometime though what Courtney is wanting or what I'm wanting. So today I'm going to be making a burger bowl with turkey instead of beef. If you want this to taste delicious, ground beef and then you put ketchup and mayo on top fire. But going to be a little healthier, you can do turkey and ketchup. Maybe a little bit of mustard. We'll see. Some pickles and lettuce. Fire. We're talking about building a healthy gut with a a diverse gut with a healthy gut. So, eating different types of food, especially fruits and \nvegetables, super helpful to more diverse gut microbiome with a healthier gut. So, I've been just buying random [ __ ] that I can put on chicken rice. So, I got a bunch of pickled onions. I got pickles. You get like kimchi, different fruits, different vegetables, \ncollections of stuff, frozen smoothie boxes that have like five fruits in them. Making your smoothie. Super simple. easy things to add in a bunch of extra food that actually just makes life more entertaining and actually healthier for you cuz you're getting a diverse gut and all the benefits from different types of \nMeal 4 \nfood. Courtney's go-to on this is\nmayonnaise and ketchup. Mix it together and then pour it on top. It's big mac sauce. Big. It's literally Big Mac \nsauce. We do with ground beef instead of turkey and then everything decks in. Bunch of salt in the Big Mac \nsauce. Look over Bradley's just so sad. Come here. We're going to say bye-bye little bear. Come to mommy. Come here. Oh yes. But yeah, Big Mac sauce is incredible. But I also just drizzled on some olive oil. The Greek Mediterranean heart health hack. And then this meal is 220 grams of ground turkey, 220 grams of rice, and it's like 15 grams, like a tablespoon of olive oil. So, it comes up to \n741 calories, 48 g of protein, 32 g of fat, 63 g of carbs. I was literally just talking about this of like the concept \nof tracking your food and how like important it is. And I wasn't competing, so I just stopped doing it. Wasn't thinking about it. And then after \ntracking for the last four or five days, cuz I'm trying to get back on a proper meal plan now that my training is sufficient, I was like so off on what I thought I was eating. And I realized when I was actually eating before and I was getting in like 4, 5, 6, 7 calories. It was like 300 g of rice instead of like 180 like I've been having. Every meal had like olive oil on it. It was like trying to get food in. And now that I'm just eating like not very much. I was probably eating like 2,00 to 2500 calories and like my weight just was stagnant. So, our wedding is \nin 6 weeks, \nright? Sorry, I'm not saying no to that. She was putting her head. I saw that. I saw her. Yeah, it's like 6 weeks. Our\nwedding's in 6 weeks. So, the last couple weeks I've been trying to eat a little bit more. My body is ready and I'm going to do like a four-week cut before the the wedding so that I can look good. So, that's like my consistent theme that I keep telling myself, but tracking is so important. And we were talking about this on the call I was just on is like even if you don't change anything, you just write down what you're eating every single day, you will eat better. Just like conscious thought of knowing what you're putting in your body and even just the accountability of like if you eat something shitty like someone eats a Snickers bar and you write down Snickers bar, next day you're like Snickers bar and you write every day you're writing it down. You're like you don't feel good writing it down. So you're probably not you're less likely to eat it. You're at least holding \nyourself accountable. So just tracking things super important. I was relating it to like mindset too and mental health and like being able to track what your thoughts are and what you're thinking and your habits and just like think about it. Journal like consistently. If you were to sit down every hour, no one's going to do this realistically and like track down what your thoughts are, what you're doing throughout the day consistently and write it down, you're probably going to start being like, \"Wow, I have a [ __ ] ton of bad habits and a bunch of bad thoughts and at least now it's in your conscious awareness and you can change it.\" So, there's a quote from my boy Carl Young. Until you make the unconscious conscious, it will control your life and you'll call it\nfate. That's probably one of my favorite quotes ever. People think fate's \ncontrolling my life, but it's just your unconscious that you're not taking the time to put into your awareness. So, with all that being said, here's my burger \nball. Tastes just like a Big Mac. Okay. So, turkey rice, shredded lettuce, pickles, pickled onions, and then a little bit of honey mustard, and then some \nketchup. So, nice fresh burger \nTOAST \nbowl. All right, so last little thing of the day. Depending on the night, it's always something different. Me and Courtney are big snackers. We got a bunch of cereal in here. We were having these mug cakes that Courtney made with sweet potato and egg white and protein powder. We're having buckwheat with protein powder, all these different things or toast. And we go through themes of just having a healthy treat at night of some sort. So toast has been the thing, \nthe taste \ndour of the \nday. I'm I got nothing in my brain right now. Ezekiel bread cinnamon raisin with some ghee butter, the goated lactoseree butter. Um, so that's is going to wrap up the day. \nIt's night time. Baby's sleeping. Going to fall asleep. So, we're in the pantry Recap \nmaking \ntoast. I'm losing my mind. I swear to God. But to go over today's calories to update and finalize this full day of eating. We are at \n3,35 calories, 289 gram of protein, 111\ngram of fat, and 270 g of carbs. So, not too shabby, right? I'm I'm pretty freaking close to my macro goals, honestly. What this is telling me to be at. Protein's a little high, but I'm trying to eat huge again. So, pretty much go a little more. Pretty much I've like I was saying, I just wasn't eating enough for a while. So, my metabolism was slowing down. I wasn't recovering. I wasn't getting enough protein or enough calories. So, also my energy was lower. So, I'm working on building that up. Still, not a crazy amount of food for myself, but the fact that this feels like I'm eating more food recently, and I'm only at 3,300 calories at 250 lb is kind of crazy. I can 100% rebuild my metabolism back up by adding more frequent, smaller meals throughout the day to the point where I could probably be like 3 to 4% body fat- wise leaner, eating the same amount of food. Like it's 100% possible if you do it right and you slowly build it up without adding too much foods fast, without adding too much shitty food, keeping your carbs at the right times a day, not too heavy in the morning, eating your carbs around training, getting enough protein in, and just those small frequent meals. So that's going to be what my goal is going to be to rebuild it up a little bit. I don't have a lot of time given I want to be like \nslimfaced and kind of lean for my wedding, which is in like a month and a half, so really not that far away. So I'm going to do the best I can until then. And then after the wedding, I'm going to eat as much as I possibly can in Europe because food there is incredible and it's just way easier to\neat and here in Europe. So, I'm going to eat as much as I can and I'm going to come back and I'm going to try and get jacked and shredded as possible. So, that will be its own series when I come back. Mini Olympia prep series type thing. But that's it. It's a full day of eating. Hope you guys like it. Maybe these will actually be a little bit different now that I'm not in prep. I can eat a little bit more off what I would typically eat even though I'm still here eating [ __ ] potato turkey and rice and chicken. Old habits die hard. But thank you guys for watching."

    "text": "Breakfast & Arm Day ? Transcript Date: 2025-11-05 \n[Music] \nAll right, so breakfast has been \nsporadic all over the place. Just got \nback from my trip still, so I'm \ncurrently like tracking my food over \nthis current week so I can see kind of \nwhat my baseline is at. sending that \nover to Justin and he's going to help me \nkind of make out a diet plan going \nforward because I really want to \nactually like start eating more \nspecifically. So, just been having an \narray of either a smoothie in the \nmorning, maybe some toast. I'm feeling \nit. And then some days I have eggs and \nsome turkey bacon. And this might be \n[ __ ] news to me and everyone knows \nthis, but most turkey bacon is like \nloaded with sugar. And I was randomly \nshopping. It was like sugarfree turkey \nbacon. I was like, \"What really?\" And I \nlook at some like 10 g of sugar and it \nwas just crazy. So, I found a sugar-free \none. A little bit of oatmeal, some \nalmond butter, and all that good stuff. \nI'm just going to sensitively talk about \nwhat I talk about now for breakfast cuz \npeople got pissed when I said I didn't \neat carbs for breakfast the other day. \nIt's valid. It's my fault for not \nexplaining things that are specifically \ntailored to me, which is fair. But like \nif I'm working out, coming back from a \nrehab, and I'm not training hard, I'm \nnot pushing volume, I'm not pushing \nheavy weight, it was more of like a \nmental focus and drive that I wanted \nwhere I personally feel more driven and \nfocused when I have lower carbs. And \nespecially if I had a lot the night \nbefore. So like tonight, I didn't have a\nlot of carbs last night. I didn't eat 3 hours before bed. And it's 10:00 a.m. already. So I'm having carbs in the morning, which I almost always have carbs in the morning, especially if I'm in like a high volume, heavy push training phase of my life. But if I have like a crazy amount of carbs and then I just go chill all day, it does make me feel less focused and a little more fatigued throughout the day. So take it with a grain of salt. Experiment with yourself. Do whatever the [ __ ] you want. But I was just in a phase of my training where I wasn't pushing heavy super hard. So that was the reason why I was doing that for myself and it works for me. Want some oatmeal with some cookie protein? \nNo. No, you don't. \nAll right. All right. So, I still can't eat plain oatmeal, even though I don't eat oatmeal as much as I used to. So, I put at least half a scoop of just some flavor in milk and cookies, but it's still the golden flavor to put in \noatmeal. And then I throw in a random amount of berries in there. We're just roasting Courtney because she ozonates the fruits and vegetables. Not actually roasting. Everyone's envious cuz ozone 03 kills bacteria. \nYes. \nSo, it's like this little machine where you just put your fruit in water and then it like ozenates it and it kills all bacteria. or if there's like [ __ ] little gross bugs or stuff on fruit and everything, pesticides hopefully cuz our crops are [ __ ] in America. So, that's what we do on our ship. \nIt's called the the in case you guys are wondering. \nYou're probably not, but I'm going to let you know anyway.\nOh, \n[Music] \nshe does this thing where she'll like kiss like she that's a kiss for her. So nice. \nGood girl. And then she'll hit. I'm \nlike, \"No, gentle.\" \nThey like kiss and she like headbutts and then \nbe gone. \nOh, it's so nice. \nThank you. \nFirst of all, I was like a scrunch. I'm like, \"Oh, scrunch.\" \nYou look great. All right. So, this \nbreakfast, like I said, right now, I \ndon't have a plan at all what I'm \neating, but I've eaten such a specific way for such a long time. I usually end up at least on the right protein goal. Most people are creatures of habit. So instead of like stressing, if you do have like a macro calculator that can push you out, like an estimate of where to start, great. If you want to just \nstart with what you're doing, also great. And then adapt from there. So that's what I'm doing. I have no plan. I'm just eating as I've been eating and then I'm tracking it over time. Right now, and then from there, I know I can make changes. Also weighing myself every day so I can see what kind of \nadjustments I want to make. This breakfast comes out to 900 calories, 60 g of protein, 50 g of fat, and 64 g of carbs. So, it's a pretty hefty ass \nbreakfast and I normally don't eat this. I'm having more because it's later in the day right now and I didn't eat before bed. Got a nice little black toffee, some fruit, my oatmeal, and we're going to have a good day. So, arms today. Going to get a sick pump. That's really all that's going on. That's four\neggs, three slices of turkey bacon, 80 g of oats, a random amount of almond butter, which equates to like two tablespoons, strawberries, and \nblackberries. \nBabe, it's okay, sweet. Oh, babe. He saved the day. \nYeah, \nget your magnet. He loves these magnets. Oh, \nhe got more. \nMore. \nSay thank you. Say thank you. \nAll right, so we were in the supplement store at Eat My Pantry, but because I just had two cups of coffee, I'm having a no stem pre-workout. Taking the pump here. Watermelon grape. Sick flavor. We're also launching this icy lemon slush, which is like just a pure \nlemonade flavor with like I don't know, it gets a more of a hint like if it were a slushie, not quite like a juice, but it just tastes really refreshing, \nespecially for a summer flavor. But this pump is technically supposed to be two scoops. My goated combo is typically one scoop of cabbage and one scoop of pump because they're technically both two scoop formulas. At their like peak, they work great at one scoop. But if I want 150 milligrams of caffeine from the fabage and then it's just a full hit of pump and everything, that's why I run the whole thing. So, it's like five \ngrams of citruline in here. A bunch of other good stuff. I also still \nconsecutively take um the revive kidney, but this has a beetroot extract in it, which is also sick for the pump. So, threw a little bit of that in there. \nThere's a random new supplement that I've been hearing about from multiple people. It's phosphatidal serereine. supposed to be really good for like\ncognition, memory, and I've been having like really bad brain fog and word and memory recollection. My ability to communicate just been lacking. We're actually looking into making a version of Babage \nwith that in the pre-workout. maybe like a really high-end I we already talked about a jackal cabbage type of thing but we got a few samples back and they didn't taste very good but because there's like five ingredients in there that are like crazy [ __ ] like \nphosphodetal steering that is like good for nutri like like neutropic focus and like getting locked in but they just taste like buttholes so we might just make the pre-workout that hits really hard and does not taste good because at the end of the day performance is what matters not taste and I don't really give a [ __ ] if it sells cuz I want to take the so that being said pump product also Arm day today. Anything else fun in here? I can take. That's what I do. Just look around. I got some extra arginine right here. Why not? This is going to be pre-workout today. Arm day. I'll see you guys at the gym. \nAll right. So, another beautiful warm day here in Florida. I think it's still several hundred?, so it's technically cold in here today. Training arms. Nothing better than a nice hot humid day training arms. My shoulder has been feeling a lot better and literally like since starting the peptides in there, like I've noticed a significant \ndifference. I don't know if it was maybe coming back from the trip, a bit of a rest I had on the trip plus that and just the culmination of all the rehab I've been doing, but it's definitely starting to feel better. So, I'm very excited about that. Still not going to\nbe an [ __ ] and put it in a position where I'm going to hurt it. But things are feeling better. Even warming up. Typically, when I'm cold with the first couple externals, it would like just feel like not good. And it jumps right into it a lot easier now. So, making some progress. I'm going to do the rest of this warm up and then jump into the workout. \nAll right, so first two exercises I'm doing a comfort curl essentially just a incline curl pretty far trying to rotate and be in a super wide stretch position. And then I'm super setting that with a Vulcan French press. So again, putting the tricep in the longest stretch position. Starting off getting a deep range of motion on both of these. Three sets of like eight. See if I can get a nice pump to start this workout off. So weird after not doing everything so consistently. I'm like I have no idea where my weights are at. I'm so much weaker than I've been. Which is such an interesting thing of this like perpetual perishable regression of life. Like if you're just living, you are regressing. If you're just doing nothing, you're getting worse. You're not getting better. It's crazy. So unless you're actually actively training to push yourself, doing the things to make yourself better, you're technically getting worse. So it's like this \nconstant like rat chase of becoming a better version of yourself. And you take a week off, you're behind. It's a hell of a world that we live in. But it makes it fun, you know? It's why it's hard to be good at what you do. \nWhen I first got these dumbbells, I wasn't sure if I like the fat grips or not, but after using them for a while now and doing something like isolated\nlike that for your bicep, but you can just like tell that squeezing the grip is like helping me just like pull from my bicep more than anything else. \nStill see the like striation in the \nmiddle of your bicep. It's super weird. I know. I didn't even used to have that. When I'm curling it comes up. \nYeah. \nBut like my arms are like pretty lean and I just like my abs are just not which often is a hormonal thing. Like high cortisol from like shitty sleep like me. Not being able to [ __ ] \noverthink stressing all the time can lead to like body fat in places like your core. So maybe all I need to do is [ __ ] go meditate and I'll have \nshredded abs. \nYeah. \nOh yeah. \nOh yeah. \nEmma, \n[Music] \nOh no. \nOh no. \nMan, \n[Music] \n[Music] \nI have notifications on only for \nCourtney to come through when I'm at the gym. She sends me three texts. I'm like, \"Fuck.\" She's like, \"I'm buying this for your stress.\" And it's some like I don't even know some virtual reality looking like headset with a brain thing time some meditation [ __ ] I don't know what that's supposed to mean when your wife is texting you that randomly in the middle of the day. Jesus. Super set lateral raise with partials. 3x 12 reps with 3x30 reps. That's a lot of reps. Damn. I got one more of the other ones. I don't actually supposed to do it on another one of the other sets, but the\nfirst set was too light. So I'm like, [ __ ] it. I want to do another set of biceps. throw another set of biceps. [Music] \nNow I can do a 100 sets of lateral raises. All right. So, this is a nasty little shoulder complex triple superset thing. Essentially, I'm going to do controlled seated lateral raise for like 12ish reps and then I'm going to do partials with heavier dumbbells. So, just at the bottom moving what I can trying to get 30 reps. See if I can do that with 30s. And then it's like a Meadows sixway shoulder complex. So still seated, do you lateral raise and then you bring the dumbbells in front of you up above your head down back forward. So six ways cuz it's 1 2 3 4 five six and that's one rep and I get like eight reps of that. So I got to do that all back to back to back. So see how this goes. \nDamn, \nthat's pretty brutal. I didn't make it to all the reps. That was close. But that's a hell of a way to get a nice little [ __ ] shoulder burn right \nthere. Damn. \nOh [ __ ] \n[Applause] \nOh [ __ ] \nAll \nright. So, after that shoulder complex, doing just like \ncan't even think. Bent over red rear delt dumbbell flies. Three sets of 20 reps. Get a nice little pump in the rear delts. And I'm going to do my little dead hangs in between to try and fix my shoulders and give my little spine a break. \nThese things really [ __ ] dig into my wrists. \nI always feel like I'm wearing an excess\namount of jewelry with a wedding ring on. It just feels like a little fancy, \nyou know? I'm so not used to it still. It feels like when I go out, if you like put a watch on or something when you're going out, a ring feels like something you put on when you go out, not when you just wear every day. And I mean, you probably can't see it, but it's already [ __ ] so scratched. \nIt's like I've worn it for 100 years. \nWonder how long it'll last working out with it. But I'm getting new blisters and calluses. I don't know if it's cuz the ring makes my skin fold in a \ndifferent way, but I can never get \ncalluses in the middle of my hand there. Boom. \nAll right, that's a wrap. Today's little arm workout. Got a nice little pump. It's weird. I feel like my arms are \nstill pretty lean. \nThey shrunk a lot. My legs are kind of lean, too. But we don't need to see the abs right now. I'll give you guys a physique update. A really humble physique update when the transformation challenge starts. I'm walking into this myself. Getting shredded getting into it. So, give you guys my first first \nphysique update, which will be very humbling as like a [ __ ] half natty seab bum. Last time you guys saw me pose was probably at Prague, which I look like a [ __ ] freak. And now I'm coming off this injury and this. But this is \nlife now. No longer a professional bodybuilder. Trying to maintain the life of work, travel, dad being a priority, and then putting in the gym is something really important to me, but not the most important thing. So managing it is definitely a little bit different now, \nbut just a new season, new obstacle challenge in life to take on. So\nfiguring as we go, but I'm going to do a little bit of cardio cuz I'm supposed to be doing that post-workout throughout this week. I have a call in an hour. So I'll have plenty of time to get a shake, some carbs, get on that, and some food later. So going to get on that. \nAll right, rolling. Still the goated way to get in protein a day is with shake. I didn't have a smoothie this morning, so I'm double scooping this right now. But I typically aim within my protein limit to get like around 75 grams of protein from powder alone. So if I have like a smoothie in the morning, I'll have a bit less after the gym, but if not, I just crank it. Quite often, if I'm like have a heavy workout or something, I just have 100 g of protein from powder. I still am a huge believer that food is the number one way to get in all your macros and everything you need, but suppleers help. Are they necessary? Do you need them to get jacked? Absolutely not. But do they make it easier and more fun and more tasty? Absolutely. So, taking two scoops of dark chocolate protein. I will never get sick of that flavor. And I've been taking this pentacarb. It's got five different sources of carbs so that your body can utilize them in different forms and make your digestion and insulin response, everything just a lot more efficient. though fancy [ __ ] that I just getting some carb powder post-workout in and some protein. I'm going put this down. I have a call right now and \nthat's it. Put me down there right now. [Music] \nThis is what I like to do when I write nutrition plans. I give you like 95% of what you want and then you feel like you're the one that's driving the specs of a certain sauce or a certain like\nwrap that you're eating or \nI mean I've since being back I've ordered a wrap from cleaning just because it's been chaos with Bradley and [ __ ] and getting back in your routine of actually cooking but other than that no I still have a snack. \nWhat what would be the thing that that would knock you off? my sleep is kicked off, everything kind of falls apart for me and then it's like a cascade effect. So like post-workout is going to be your highest carb meal every single time. Even on the high day, like when you're allocating 506 g of carbs, you could do like 150 180 g of carbs in that \npost-workout meal. \nAll right. \nAppreciate it. Thank you, sir. All right. \nYeah. Good seeing you. Talk to you soon. Later. \ngetting a [ __ ] trailer. \nLike this is like the rough start of like just getting a feel for things. So I sent him what my calories were, what I've been eating consistently, and it was 2600 calories, 90 g of fat, 186 g of carbs, 253 g of protein. That was like me tracking for a few days. So he made that my baseline, which was like your average day. That's what I'm going to eat. And then I have a high day, which I'll be having here. \nUm, I don't think we figured out exactly how many times, but on like leg days, so like twice a week, I'll be having a high day, which is that's the day where my protein drops down to 130 g of protein, and then my carbs go up to 500. So, it allows me to eat 500 g of carbs, but my calories only go up 200 for my baseline, which is like nothing. So that like he was saying the goal is just like \nperformance drive your glycogen stores\njust like jam it get that insulin \nresponse and then for the next couple days you have like the ability to push harder in the gym and you're not going to lose muscle from having one day with low protein like you're going to be completely fine especially with that much carbs which are also anabolic and then the low day is the same amount of protein \nmore fat less carbs so it's only 100 less calories but I'm just alternating throughout those days and this is something that I never did this strictly except for near the end of my career, but it really allowed me to not plateau with my dieting. Like people are always like, I'm eating this amount. I just cut 1,000 calories out and I lost 10 lbs in a week, but then I just stopped losing weight. And it's like your body is so good at adapting. Like our bodies are meant to be able to survive when we're starving if we can't find food for a while. So if we're starving ourselves, our body will hold on to stuff as much as possible. So, if you keep giving it like a high day, like I'm going to give you a lot of food and energy and then pull you back down, the up and down can allow you to like curve down \nconsistently and keep getting leaner rather than if you just pull yourself down and you get stuck there and then flatline. So, the goal is to be able to like essentially carb cycle, which is a super basic ass thing to do, and then follow this. This is just telling me \nwhere my nutrients should be within the day. So depending when I train, keeping my highest carbs post-workout, have a shake with carbs post-workout. Before bed, making sure I have some carbs so my insulin is not or my blood sugar is not crashing in the middle of the night,\nwhich can cause an increase of cortisol. And obviously, you can't sleep good with high cortisol. And then little things like get 10k steps, which is a lot for me cuz I get like 2500 steps in a day right now. Chew a lot, eat whole foods. Like it's just basic [ __ ] Wear blue light glasses. stay off your phone, don't eat too close to bed, and then a bunch of supplements that for me right now are revolved a lot a lot around like my brain and just helping me like de-stress and focus. And then also my gut. So, it's kind of like a extensive baseline plan to start with right now. And then once we're rolling here and I'm like back in the system of eating [ __ ] five meals a day, which I'm not used to, then it can get even more specific and keep changing."

showing me how to build a big back but this is i mean we've already introduced him on the raw podcast that we posted on instagram and everything but our newest wrong athlete another mr brett wilkin he probably was one of the \nbiggest outburst athletes of last year in the pro league so we're super honored to have him on the team he's a good dude as well known him for like five years and heard nothing but good things about him so we thought we'd bring him on the team maybe move him down to florida if we're lucky enough to have him but other than that we're just gonna be heading back today trying to huge having some fun so hope you guys enjoy \nyep hold it hold it right there \ngood \nelbow \nyes \ngood \nall right \noh \n[Music] \nall the way down \n[Music] \nperfect \nyep \n[Music] \nyes \n[Music] \nwe have to do this one first because my hands get so wet here from the humidity that i won't be able to grip that it's hot \nall right so we're starting this workout with some pull downs with the prime handle here \nit's nice using this because you can actually rotate within it so you can stretch and rotate your elbows in on the way down \nthe only thing that's really hard to hold so when you get over like 10 plus reps my brachialis just starts to burn the horrible forearms but probably a good thing so starting off with this stretch it a little bit warm up and then move on to some rows or something he's running the workout\ncome on yes \nperfect \nsqueeze yes \n[Music] \nyes stay forward stay forward drive through you good \nstep drive pass drive fast \nyes \n[Music] \noh \n[Music] \ngood \n[Music] \nhere we go come on \n[Music] \n[Music] \nyes \noh come on \ngood \nhow do you feel what how do you feel good yeah \nthese machines are all very lovely on back there i don't always love prime but that like \nrotation you can get in your wrist will really lock your elbows in personally helps me a lot on the chest supported rows so the few prime attachment we've been using feel really good \ni really focus now on my back like through at least three of the exercises i actually hold each rep in the \ncontraction so i squeeze my back like i'm hitting a pose on stage and then i let it go and that really helps me with my mind muscle connection so \nnot as it can go heavy but it helps [Music] \ncome on \ncome on \nyep \nknocked the window to me i lost my breath on like the fourth one i was like gasping for air \num \nall right just in here \n[Music] \n[Music] \n[Music] \n[Music] \ncome on \nperfect \ni honestly think raw \nyou guys should make here \nthat's the size this is like\nmy favorite ever they're so easy you know \nwhat's that it's just a small cup of egg right yeah but they're not eight it's like half an hour so it is just here it's a quick wrap and that's it \n[Music] \n[Music] \noh \n[Music] \noh \nholy [ __ ] \n[Music] \nyep \n[Music] \nhere we go \ngood \nyep \nyes \n[Music] \nhere we go \nhere we go \nall right so that's a wrap on today's back workout did a pretty successful training session as always we keep the volume decently low and we do like one or two working sets but it's all you need we're gas by the end and you can't even pull anymore because we're actually putting the work into each set so it's good training with mr brett over here fourth workout probably of many if you move down here but probably my whole career i've traded with people bigger than me so it's just like in my mind that i'm usually the smallest guy in the gym so it's always good to have bigger guys coming in kind of make you strive for more even though i'm in classics there's always room for improvement always room to grow even if i'm close to my weight caps so good training session i'm gonna head home grab some food and maybe wrap up the video there i'm not really sure what we're doing but thank you guys for tuning in and \nyour youtube channel brett the butcher the butcher welcome brett the butcher welcome check it out we're going to

make this dream achievable been working on this for a very long time and um it's been great because of the vast variety of machines and being able to use not only the biomechanics to really help you create that better contraction but also being able to adjust for \ndifferent heights and I mean we have my wife was here works on her uh you got somebody as tall as Chris being able to work on him and everything in between so that's what's really great about it so many different machines that work so well so uh great thing about it is that Chris is going to be here for a couple more days we're going to be working on legs we're going to be working on arms we're going to be working on uh back we're going to be working on shoulders so we got a bunch of different uh workouts coming um but I
