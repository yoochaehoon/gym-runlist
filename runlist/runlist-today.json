Chest Workout & Coaching Announcement (Transcript) Compiled: 2025-11-01 08:07:32 \nwhat is up YouTube \n[Music] \n[Music] \nforeign \n[Music] \n[Music] \npeople forget like you make decisions and you just like feel it out you live \nyour life and then the world's talking \nabout it like why are you hiding this and it's just like I've just lived in my \nlife you know but yeah so as you guys know video before this I guess will be sadly meaning they're no longer working together but the exciting news is me and honey are working together now the \nprocreator the 20 times the Olympia Champion coach 20 20. \nsoon to be a few more hopefully more yeah oh yeah we've been working together for a few weeks we I mean we \nstarted talking in August officially and I kind of shocked him a little bit he \ndidn't know I would want I \nwas like talking briefly like maybe we could like help me a little bit like this \nand that and then I called him I was like so how do you feel about \ncoaching me he's like a [ __ ] coach coach like everything I'm like yeah he's like [ __ ] man at the last minute it was \ndefinitely from Left Field a lot of people think this thing's been going on for a long time it actually hasn't a lot \nof it had to do with the fact that when we started talking originally I think it \nwas the Arnold we were just the first \ntime we were just you know conversing but later on it was more about just hey what are your different techniques regarding you know mental mindset and some of those other things and \neventually there were some videos that were made regarding us working together when we weren't working together and the \nonly thing that came about that was the conversation of eventually men working together it actually started the \nconversation it wasn't what was actually happening which is really funny I have the text of her it's my text message hey \nTony hey it's Chris it's my number the next one what the [ __ ] is this video man you text me the question mark question \nmark what's this video like people saying we're coaching and I'm like [ __ ] like let me call you in a second and I called them and I was like well like you know I've been like we've talked about you helping me with my [ __ ] and you know somehow we got out there whatever and then it would blew up and I was like so \nwhat do you think I was like oh you're serious \nbe pretty cool and he said no no no let's think about doing the whole prep and then obviously it was a very big \ndecision because it was came from Left Field because I I've never somebody who's\nan actual somebody who's actually \nbeen winning the Olympia in the past when I worked with other athletes it was somebody that had started with me or had \nended up winning the Olympia with me or had come back after losing the Olympia uh 2009 Jay Cutler \num but it wasn't obviously it's a lot of pressure but it was also from left field so there was a lot of conversations back \nand forth on how that would work but uh obviously as I got to know Chris and be able to talk to him many many hours on \nthe phone FaceTime all those things being able to understand kind of what the process is what his process is I \nfelt like it was a it was going to be something or I could definitely help sure yeah I mean I don't think you were \ntoo fond that it was 16 weeks out or what whatever it was yeah because he says like I only work \nwith people and have a full year of off-season learning your body getting where I want and then we start prep and I'm just starting prep like this so but we're gonna make it work you know yeah I thought my first rodeo it's not your first rodeo so a little challenge too \nbut we'll make it work yes I'm excited you know like you guys know me I'm very laid back I'm pretty like loose like just try and chill take what I can Honey's very like everything's got to be perfect like what's this going on what's this what's this what's this very like \nmeticulous and I think the combination of those two things of him like filling the gaps where I might like Overlook because I'm just like do my [ __ ] and he's like on it for me I think that's gonna flow together really well you know what I'm told to do I do is 100 and he's \ngonna tell me what to do and then we're gonna [ __ ] do it so excited yeah and you're not used to being told what to do \na little bit but not fully new everybody laughs at that our house Courtney Calvin are like oh my God someone telling what \nto do I'm like is that that rare for me but I guess so so I know I can hear it though and it'll be exciting to try \nsomething you knew you know obviously we've spoken we're not changing the wheel no you know I mean obviously he's \none it's the thing but there's a lot of Young and Hungry guys coming after you want to really try to make some improvements and like you said ideally I'd like to live to start working together in January or February but um it just it stars aligned right now and \nthis is what we want to do because we want to be able to try to bring in the best version of Chris possible and just \nget in there and try to combine the formulas and be able to take it to the next level forever Improvement yeah yeah \nyeah I mean it's been good so far you know not a huge change of stuff you got some fst7 sets we add in little things \nbut overall training is similar it's intense keep your strengths at the beginning of prep like I always do I \nstill get to do my heavy squats my heavy presses all that [ __ ] with the little\ntweaks on the end so yeah it's been good so far and I know we'll be going forward \nso yeah yeah I'm gonna [ __ ] [ __ ] up four-time Olympia coming up soon that's it brother all right now it's chest day \nso we got to get to work we'll show you how we work right now so stay tuned so let's start start with the incline let's \nget you warmed up there see how you feel and then if everything feels really good we'll start moving \nstuff done early and then we can use some fs7 stuff again but let's just really make sure that you have the \nability to be able to do that everything so we can build that base to keep it stronger yeah \nso did you start a heavy dumbbells start there and there after you're warmed up and we do a good working set two working \nsets there then we're going up here all right [Music] \nhave you used this machine before no okay you just got it like I was looking for one myself \nthe actual start oh maybe a little bit yeah \n[Music] \nhalf inch one's actually okay \njust go a little lighter you're still kind of a little narrow yeah it's good for warm-up but as we get into heavier \nsets it should go a little wider and you know you have to wait it seems like you would \nbe amazing but you want my elbows play up here or more like lower not out just right there right here \n[Music] \nyou'll have a little \nright come on Chris got it good \ndon't go again all the way up push push press push fire \nhigher higher oh good slow good job [Music] \nthe heavy machine it's a good movement though yeah as \nyou're arching and you're driving it's perfect just make sure you keep your chin up so you can just make sure you get a little extra on the very end because sometimes you're gonna have to catch yourself not being able to extend all the way chin down because you feel \nlike your chest is flexed all the way it really is it yeah a little further up I feel like I'm flexing harder when I do this you know because I'm like pushing it all the subconscious then I'll just \ngo here right now a little bit \nslowly number three two one \nthere you go come on \ncome on \ngood partial three three one two one \nmore \nheavy it is heavy yeah ain't no Hammer strikes \nyep it's all Flex machine is very heavy so if you never use a support it definitely it literally feels like three plates if not more in a way so I feel\nlike it's almost three place when you're using it or do you feel like like you're mentioned three please yeah yeah a lot \n140s one I think 140 would be good because you just did six and it felt okay but you're a little tired from last \nnight's right now yeah so I think like if we're going to be pushing into that set range about eight to ten I don't think you're going to be able to if you feel 150 is solid or if you feel like \nwhen I first exercised on a good day start with 150 I get 10. okay so after that you just went over that first exercise too \nright \nfor the light [Music] \nseconds go go go \none more \nperfect symmetry yesterday we do rows 140s press 140s balances here you probably don't have a weak back it's all about the balance yeah same way let's go \nwhat on the way let's go \nwith me \n[Music] I feel so good controlled but hard \nbefore that so let's move into a power press while \nwe're still on the incline mom's new show do you want to go with that wedding kind uh \nno I want to keep it gear I want to work on that upper see how that goes I've been doing this every chest and they \nfeel good but it's just different for me the way I have the long arms it's hard for me to tuck like when I'm pressing \npeople out with a girl but it's so flared but like my arms are just so long so when I do this actually you need to stay gloves it's a good mix I guess yeah if you get some good flexion yeah you're keeping your shoulders and back and your chest out it's just arch your back and \nthen just drive this prep yeah because I think that other spot is just gonna be good good chin up okay they're good there you go come on \nChris \n[Music] good looking out go \npush push it together together good job good \nnot bad don't feel better a little more speed though yeah \nsolid definitely got a good range of motion on it too fast \nthis is all about like a foundation set that you're going to be able to use as much weight as possible within reason \nwithout getting hurt but keeping it in that eight to ten range but work your way up to it but this is going to be one \nof those things where we're not going to be doing like I don't want to do any just really get up to that point where \nyou hit that 8-10 then you feel like it's too late so \nwe're here \nwithout six and see if that's still warming up \ngoing out the working set and making sure \n[Music]\n[Music] \ngo go come on \nslow slow slow [Music] \nwe're doing the tricks there one more one more one more I still know how to count \npays off [ __ ] they're counting over and I don't understand one thing I was excited about when we \nstarted working together I think a lot of people misconstrue what fsd7 is and they just think you're a huge volume guy and people like Chris you don't train like that at all blah blah I was like it's not how he trains not everything is seven sets of 20 and like killing it's like still the foundation same as always muscle requires strength to hold on to \nwhen you're prepping you're eating less you need to be strong to hold on to that muscle so like it's still listening \nheavy if not heavier than I've always trained at this point in prep and then you throw in some volume at the end or \nthe beginning if you need it right and as you do at the end but it's still getting strong and with some heavy weight same [ __ ] it's a little harder at the end yep just making sure you manipulate both \ntypes of fibers because you need to be able to be stronger so you can handle heavier weights so that even when you're \ndoing high volume you use heavier weight on high volume a lot of people think that it's just seven sets for two or \nthree exercises and that's it and you go lighter it's not how it works if they wish it'd be nice if you get used that \nwouldn't even be fun actually no one wants that gotta earn it \nthe picture good \ncome on slow I need slower negative I need so \nI'm going to help with the positive that's why it looks so easy come on together now slow hold it hold it there hold it hold it come on Chris work on the East Center come on slow slow one more one more come on let's go finish strong slow \ngood and release good job \nit's beautiful I love it there you go \nI feel ashamed Connie told me I had to shave my legs because my legs are so [ __ ] hair you can't tell how lean \nthey are I never shave my legs until like four weeks out last minute unless you're leaving to shave my calves so I'm \nlike a Hobb it up to my knee it might be a new look see if I can get this trending I guarantee you you can't \nI hope not \ngood \none more good warm-up sets are open \nthis is the goat test machine do you have it find it take all the stress out of bicep forearms everything it just \nsqueezes from the elbow which feels great hard to find though yeah very hard to find one of my favorite machines I \nused to use this back when I was competing really helps with getting that really\ngreat contraction without having \nyour arms kick in like Chris said and what you want to do is you want to make sure that I like to go in over and under \njust so that you don't end up just using one side as a dominant side so every rep switch \n[Applause] nice come on \nkeep going keep going go go [Music] \ngood go go come on Chris come on you got this \nyou got this three-part let's go one one two two \nthat's it \nwe have worked long the long work the other long enough for me to know what he looks made just a blank's there like \neither this guy looks like [ __ ] right now or he looks decent you know film that I'll never know you will know \nyou're finally working out properly you're finally \na judgment from this guy you're the Lord still they can't power clean 300 pounds he's an Olympic lifter so oh really just my Mobility all the time \nlet's go it's time to work it's time to work [Music] \nokay \nkeep it moving good good nope pause the top come over pause pause good partials go there you go again good again \ntwo more again [Applause] hold it come on right there hold on slow aren't your back put it on your chest slow slow down slow good shot there you go I thought you made it later no I went \nheavier I went heavier \nrestaurants \nyou're like a most muscular yeah very good \nthree more seconds [Music] two and one \ndefinitely Fuller okay a little more fullness through the pack definitely upper chest is really pushy what we were \ntalking about trying to fill you up in the Carbone area yeah right through there that made some improvements the \nlast couple weeks and um trying to jam in as much as you can in terms of these types of different \nvariations and these exercises to get those muscles to grow those muscular just I just want to see \nwhat that looks like on you chest up yeah there you go \n10 weeks out today so it's out today \nthank you \nthere you go \noh my God \ncome on \nlet's go right there good Arch good good \njob come on that's it come on Chris \ntogether good squeeze the steps good there you go there you go boom good sweet good job come on Drive good keep going good one good set to failure let's go good good one more \nnow go to a press right there good watch your back good good closer in a little\nbit more right there good March back

drive it I'll help you one more like that one more like that control good good all the way all the way all the way good job \nokay so one thing I have to notice is that you sometimes \n[Music] \nforeign \nforeign \nfor a few days trying to get shredded trying to get huge fine-tuning everything make sure everything's right \non point where we want it to be for the rest of the prep 10 weeks out today so getting close but yeah I mean new coach \nthis year not a whole lot of variables crazy things are going to change I think he's pretty basic and he pretty like \njust persistent on Little Things fine-tuning them everything you need to do is level yourself up getting better \nhe always says one percent one percent one percent one percent adds up slowly and gets you to be 10 20 better which \nadds up slowly even a few percentage at my level is a big change so it's exactly what I'm trying to do right now just \nfine tune all the little things for those of you who don't know honey maybe\nsomething because they're young or not in the bodybuilding World he's coached some absolutely amazing people and does some creative things with them from Phil Heath Jay Cutler Seth roasty coaching \nDerek Lunsford right now hottie children a whole bunch of people very successful and honestly I never thought that I \nwould ever want him to coach me I never was like he's good good he's had success he's worked with other people who are good who you know I never were like oh he's who I want I always respected what he had done obviously because he'd been very good but I never wanted anyone other than e and The Coachman I never even thought outside of that because it's just we were with an Olympians why would I change you know but circumstances presented itself or we needed to change and I met Hani and she kind of like lined up perfectly right when I was thinking we coached me I met \nhim and I spoke with him and I was like [ __ ] I just like connected with what he was saying I saw how passionate he was and how intense he was about winning and \nobsessed he wasn't winning and like being the best version that you can be for yourself beating yourself the year \nbefore all the way we spoke and communicate about his mindset and the way he handles stress and kind of has worked with competitors at a high level winning multiple championships which people don't understand the level of like mentality that comes into like \nwinning again and again and again and keeping not getting comfortable not letting your foot off the gas and kind \nof keep pushing harder because people are getting better and better especially when you set up new standard they're reaching that new standard getting better so you keep setting a new standard every year and he knows how to do that so you know when we spoke and I \nkind of connected with someone like [ __ ] this just felt right the timing was perfect and I kind of kept it inside me for like six months since we're back at the Arnold I think when we first spoke and I didn't speak to him didn't say anything I was just like that could be interesting you know maybe and here we are so I'm excited it's been great so far I feel like I'm in a very good spot at this point and I'm fired up I'm \nmotivated I just feel excited for this Olympia prep right now I'm feeling good so shit's gonna be good very good very \nexciting we'll keep you along for the ride but yeah that's about it that's all that's going on to get some food to me because I was starving after that workout got legs tomorrow gonna kill myself and then he's gonna fly out tomorrow wrap it up and back to regular \nscheduled programming so thank you guys for watching catch you in the next one Generated for Gym project ? single-PDF transcript compilation."

    "text": "CBum ? Full Day of Eating (Off?Season) ? Transcript \nCompiled on 2025-11-01 \nwhat is up YouTube it's been a minute \nsince I've been in my kitchen so we are \nback doing another full day of eating \nthis off season the last time I checked \nin I think \nI cannot remember but I think of around \n240 ish pounds the last little David did \nI just weighed myself right now of 255 \npounds and it's a true weight of a \nlittle bit more the last few days \nbecause I was like eat a little bit it \nwas a little bloated holding on some \nwater but I got a massage and just \nflushed it all out so today I was 255 \npounds a month like 15 pounds from \nwhatever still got like \n10 months until the Olympia and last \nyear my biggest weight was like 264. so \n10 more pounds and I'll be the biggest \nI've ever been but to the food because \nI'm hungry and a little bit late so \ntypically I've still been doing pancakes \nalmost every morning but two times a \nweek I have this concoction right here \nat this shake I'm about to show you but \nright now I dropped Courtney off at the \nairport like 5 a.m came back fell back\nPage 1 \nasleep and I just don't feel like making pancakes right now so it's gonna be the shake today it's super simple nothing crazy literally just blending up protein oats and some almond butter and then with that I eat a bagel I could do more oats in the shake technically but if you put like 120 grams of oats in a shake and drink it it just tastes like you're drinking sand and it's not that good but you can get away it was like 60 to 70. and the trick that I like to do is if \nyou put ice or even better if you put fruit I just didn't really feel like \nhaving a fruit smoothie do you put fruit or ice or something that's gonna add maybe slight texture to it you're less likely to feel the oats we're right in front of me you're less likely to feel the oats in the drink and it'll be \neasier to get them \nso I have 70 72 grams of Oats I do two scoops of protein \nI typically either go with chocolate or cookies and cream for this shake going with cookies and cream today to do a scoop of fiber \nif I do one scoop of five or the total fiber and this is seven grams and I'm also getting a good amount from The Oaks so beautiful way to start the day with\nPage 2 \nabove the fiber go to the bathroom nice and well and then I add in I'm almost out of almond butter this is like the scraps \nif you look in our cupboard over in the corner where we keep our almond butter we probably have I don't know at least 10 at this point almond butters that look like this because corny I mean worse than this corny only likes it when they're like Smooth at the top and you can like drizzle it onto her food so when it gets some of this little scraps she leaves it and I just usually use it for shakes so it doesn't go to waste but that's how we eat on butter in this house I usually do 15 grams that's 19. so bonus four grams today 19 grams of almond butter and then I'm going to blend this up \nand I'm going to toast the bagel and I'm going to put on some ghee butter you can eat grass-fred butter as well this is grass-fed clarified ghee butter which means they've taken the lactose out of it and put it through a process to try and kind of get rid of some of the [ __ ] in it so it's supposed to be a little healthier but I don't know it makes I like enjoy it better it has a little bit of a different taste to it this one also\nPage 3 \nhas added pink Himalayan salt to it so it tastes even better \nall right so quick and easy breakfast I literally think I made that in like 11 minutes so if you ever want to get out the door and get in a [ __ ] I mean I haven't eaten yet but if you want to get out the door quick get them a bunch of calories this is a good way to do it also I've been taking \nthis glucose product twice a day once with breakfast and once when I have like a pasta meal post workout or something or if I'm not trading that day and I don't have that huge meal I probably won't have it you can also buy berberine Crow meat chromium and a bunch of stuff like that separately and put it together but this is like a stacked formula like a bunch of vitamins chromium berberine as well as cinnamon extract a bunch of other stuff in it as well to help you kind of digest and shuttle carbs where you want them to be so it just helps in the off season if you're eating a lot of carbs but aside from that this is \nbreakfast I got two scoops of protein 70 grams of Oats 19 grams of almond butter I got one and a half Bagels covered in ghee butter and I think that's all \nthat's in here so this whole thing super\nPage 4 \neasy to eat is 1 \n344 calories so great way to mash down in the morning break that fast and try and get huge \nall right huh don't eat it every day my bagels are damn good when you do get to eat them I also wanted to mention that I am going to be at the Arnold this year it's in like two weeks I believe so a bunch of people have been asking me if I'm going to be there I will be there I'm going to be not with a sponsor I have a bunch of stuff going on Dom's going down there for a bunch of meetings I have to join him for a few meetings so I'll be busy but I'm just going down there to try and meet you guys meet a bunch of you guys there's going to be an option if you want to pay to get a VIP ticket to come and see \npeople such as myself Jay Cutler Ronnie Coleman big Ramy I think a bunch of people like that are gonna have like the options where you can guarantee to see them and then those people are going to be sifted through first in the line so that they're guaranteed their spot to see someone because honestly the last few events I've gone to people waited like hours and didn't even get a chance to see me or whoever they were waiting\nPage 5 \nfor and that just sucks and I don't want to waste anyone's time or \nhow to upset a new one so this will be the option and then after we'll cycle through a normal line but I can't \nguarantee I see someone all the time so if I can't I truly am sorry we are \ntrying to do our best to appease \neveryone in the way that they get to get what they want at these events but they're always crazy they're always hectic I think the website does say something about paying for a sign something or other but if you guys bring anything to me I'm not gonna make you pay for it just be polite be nice be like hey man can you please sign this and I'll sign it should try to have a marker ready or something like that on you so if you show up with a piece of paper and a marker \nand nice and you're nice you want me to sign something I always will I won't say no just come up say what's up have a chat get a picture I'll sign whatever you guys want and yeah we'll have a good time it's gonna be a crazy weekend these weekends honestly kind of give me anxiety because like \nI have to go somewhere and like talk to people for six hours and get in line\nPage 6 \nwith your love but then even getting there takes me like three hours because I can't walk there I can't work out on these weekends at all because I go to a gym and it's just people asking me to stop being chatting with you there so it's a lot of work it's a [ __ ] show but I am grateful for the opportunity to get to meet a lot of you guys so if you are there then hopefully be at the meet say what's up and have a good time but I'm gonna put this down get out of here and see you guys again for meal number two all right meal number two getting real creative get a real good at cooking this time eating this \nprobably should be showing that instead but so I told you guys my last video I ordered mega fit meals I don't eat all my meals from this but they're just it's easy to get a bunch like this in a week this one is seven ounces of certified Black Angus steak and two cups of rice so I don't know how accurate the reading is on here but it says 890 calories for this meal so not a bad way to get in a meal but I'm gonna throw this in a glass dish so I'm not warm enough plastic all the time and gonna Heat this up and then an apartment this morning that I had to run to so I'm\nPage 7 \ngonna run into work eat the next meal after that and we're gonna head to the gym I think and train back but I'm not filming that workout because it's full day of eating not a workout video but yeah cheat code \nmeal prep even if you have like six or seven that you order a week it's not it's realistically it's cheaper than \neating Chipotle and if you just have one a day on that meal that you're like oh I don't have a meal right now I'm not prepared I'm running at the door it's a lunch at work or something and that meal is a pre-made healthy meal high protein whatever you're gonna be better off than ordering [ __ ] Chick-fil-A or \nsomething even though Chick-fil-A is amazing but yeah it's just a little helpful tip all right so this is meal number three prison my pre-workout meal typical day it goes breakfast then I come in the office and I usually eat meal number two but I was a little late today so I ate that home and then I have this at like four o'clock go to the gym at like five but I have the what's in here with me today because Courtney is on a trip and me and the Watson are having some father's daughter bonding time so it's just me and her for a while\nPage 8 \nwe're gonna have some crazy parties have fun so it's gonna be good but meal number three is six ounces of chicken and two cups of rice so similar to my last meal but chicken instead of beef I like to have chicken rice before the gym usually because it's your most basic meal ever and it's just easy to digest mega fit says this is 760 calories in here so I'm hoping that's right but I'm gonna put this down \nprobably put some hot buffalo sauce on it just for a little bit of flavor a \nlittle bit of kick it's a little spicy \nthan I would have liked but it still tastes amazing I'm gonna eat this throw down some pre-workout probably some repeat because it's a goat flavor and then I'm gonna head to the gym and I'll see you guys after the gym for my post workout meal whatever the hell it's gonna be \nall right so post workout meal this is another trade secret \nI learned this on accident because I was eating sweet potato on prep and I was like why the [ __ ] is it like this much sweet potato for the amount of calories they should be eating so I stopped baking it but if you bake or air fry sweet potato the volume of it becomes\nPage 9 \nlike a tenth of what it is \nbefore cooking it I'm not really making much much sense right now I'm starving pretty much showing prep I boil my sweet potatoes so it's like a little more voluminous but if you cut up the sweet potato into like nice little bits like this almost like little fries \nand then you cover it in oil on the pan more calories as well and then you bake the [ __ ] out of it for like an hour to the point where I like where some of them get burnt like some of them literally turn black and you have to throw those out and the rest are like a little crispy but just cooked it shrinks them down a lot \nit makes them way easier to eat so in this bowl I have 500 grams of raw white sweet potato which was like a full Bowl it wasn't that much but it was a good sad bowl and it shrunk down to literally nothing in here and I also have 165 grams of ground turkey I also ate a banana while I was waiting for that to heat up because I was starving when I got home \nbut like I was saying super easy to eat this is what I normally would have pasta but I don't really want to have pasta at the moment and for those that always\nPage 10 \ncall me up I say pasta the correct way you say pasta the wrong way so don't don't even say that again \nbut this meal comes up to 779 calories with \nthe banana so not a huge meal but still like I said getting 500 grams of potato down that easily is very helpful so another little Pro tip to bulking \ngetting more calories is baked the sugar sweet potato so it shrinks down cut it up and cover it into oil as well that's what gives it crispy and gives it a little more flavor so I'm gonna eat this shower and probably eat again soon because I'm hungry and it's not a huge meal so I'll catch you for a meal number five \nall right so meal number five I \ncompletely started eating this and forgot I was doing a full day beating that's how horrible of a YouTuber I am last this next meal is I blast the back of the sweet potato because it was delicious a little bit less this time I had 300 grams worth of sweet potato and the sweet potatoes weighed raw and then I just like I weigh it raw and then I weigh it cooked and then I do like the conversion so I know how much it is because it's easier to measure it raw on\nPage 11 \nmy fitness pal so 300 grams raw weight through potato 170 grams of ground beef which Courtney cooked into patties before she left and half an avocado so I have that kind of mixed up in here it's kind of like a bunless burger and sweet potato fries I don't know it's pretty good to me but this meal comes up to comes up to like 690 700 calories ish I don't know my math isn't so hot but I'm getting in some fats later in the day post workout I didn't have a bunch of fat because you just want to get some carbs in at that point and I saw your digestion at all not that it's like that crucial because of eating so close to metal coat anyways but that's just my method of doing things I like having fat before bed too so it keeps me sustained longer after this I'm probably gonna throw down like a shake or something I normally have two shakes a day and I'm probably gonna finish today with one of those so I'm gonna eat this finish this Connie episode and I'll catch you guys for the final snack all right so meal number six if you go on a call it a meal we are back right where we started with another Shake I have 80 grams of oats in there taking this GI product before bed and revive and I also\nPage 12 \nthrow glutamine in here every night glutamine does help with recovery but it's also really good for your gut so take a little gut health thing at night to make sure I'm eating all this food and it's actually being absorbed and digested properly \nthen I'm going to have a single scoop of chocolate protein because who doesn't not love \nto not love who doesn't love chocolate milk before bed just it's a goat and it's like a rich dark chocolate so gotta love it and then finally I have \n30 grams 32 grams whatever how close it gets of almond butter which is \nequivalent to two tablespoons I already won and \nLucas Boom for good luck everybody just doesn't get a little \none of those things it's always \ndelicious \nalways pulls through some people are afraid to drink their calories and I'm not gonna lie I am that person \nI just have this like innate belief in me that real food is better which it is I believe it is but \nI'm getting enough real food in the day I'm positive of that I have enough real food so that if I have a shake in the\nPage 13 \nmorning and at night or whatever and in between I'm getting all the food I need then I'm good to go and I'm not really going to stress it \nand haven't been the biggest eater lately so these are some things that kind of help me get stuff in \nthe number one tips I always say when you're bulking I mean people either struggling with dieting or struggling with bulking currently I'm struggling with bulking but digestion \nabsolutely crucial first thing to help digestion to drink a [ __ ] ton of water drink a lot of water don't like kill yourself but drink a lot of water it takes off like glutamine GI from revive you can take digestive supplements if you're eating like really huge meals but really you want to be eating types of foods that your body like enjoys like reacts will digest well so that you don't need a digestive take stuff like berberine and stuff like the glucose product revive has those can also help you well shuttle your carbs so it kind of helps your insulin and your appetite stays where it needs to be doing cardio helps a lot I started doing cardio about four times a week right now I have an actual road bike outside that I ride my\nPage 14 \nbike while sometimes people might think it's counterintuitive to do cardio on a bulk when you're trying to gain weight it's not at all the it helps your \ncardiovascular health which you absolutely need when you're putting away on top of that it does help you like able to eat more so pretty much focus on energy output as well as digestion and you should be good to go just eat food you enjoy and worst case scenarios blend some oats in a shake and it's an easy way to get some food down trust me you can take into your workout carbs eat lots of fats I don't even eat a lot of fats today and I still have my calories so I'm doing pretty good I often have uh pasta throughout the day you guys have seen but today I'll do hidden sweet potatoes for my carbs after the gym find things that are calorically dense that you just enjoy to eat for me it's pasta just easy to eat or sweet potato and they just go down like it's nothing but to get to the end of this video my total calories of the day are 5 145 calories so I'm right now I'm probably trying to aim around 4 800 to 5 000 I'm over it today awesome better but I'm not too worried about being very specific with my calories I change up\nPage 15 \nwhat I eat but typically breakfast is either the shake or pancakes and then I always have two mega fit meals during the day the same meals I showed you and then throw the sweet potato or past that night so there's really only two options I have in there but I'm very consistent and I don't really care if I'm within like 10 of my gold and I'm usually pretty good \nthe the macros are going to be a little bit skewed on this because of the mega fit meals but it's somewhere around 500 carbs 140 grams of fat and 265 grams of protein \nit's a pretty good right on point there a lot of bodybuilders when they get to a certain point of eating a lot of \nfood they try and add a little more protein to get their calories in because it kind of makes a little bit more \nsluggish when you're eating a [ __ ] ton of carbs makes you tired sleep all the time if you know Ian he literally just sleeps all the time because he is eating more than me and either way bigger than me so one thing they can do is eat more protein but because of my autoimmune my kidneys and stuff I try and focus on not getting a crazy amount of protein I stick around a pound per body weight at\nPage 16 \nmy bowl which I'm right around I'm a little over today I'm sure that's higher than it should have been higher than it says on my fitness pal but that's okay I'll survive we're not it's only eating like 400 grams of protein but for the average person it's okay if you do that so \nyeah I mean there's not many secrets to bulking other than eating a lot unless you're someone who gains fat too easily then you got to take it a lot slower but if you're someone who's skinny and hard gaining and you're like how do I get big you just got to eat more listen your body eat more follow the scale look at your body fat you don't want to be getting fat in your off season you do not need to be fat so just \nbe consistent I'm rambling because I'm really tired right now and this is like one of those things we've talked too much when you're tired \nalso here in chip \nI'm alone this is my first time sleeping in this new house alone \nso I'm probably gonna it's probably haunted and they're gonna go through gonna come and kill me tonight because I'm alone usually how it works but anyways I'm gonna put this shake down 5\nPage 17 \n000 calories will be in my belly hopefully getting huge 255 pounds road to 265. it's a goal for the end of both so I will keep you guys along the way thank you guys for watching and I'll catch you in the next one\nPage 18 "

Morning Routine & Shoulder Day (Transcript) Compiled PDF ? 2025-11-01 \ndo I have abs GH cut [ __ ] debab that g cut yeah I'm Miss natti's liver King bro gotcha come on come on Chris come on two more free time Olympia Champion let's go [Applause] [Music] what is up YouTube I should be saying good morning YouTube we're going to be giving you guys a morning routine video right now we did last year people always like doing that stuff so I'm going to be telling you guys everything I do from when I wake up to I a little bit post breakfast I guess but pretty much wake up I try and get a liter of water in the morning CU I piss like a racehorse through the night usually lose like 6 lbs so I try and drink this in the morning brush my teeth clean my retainer put that all away and then I try and to away myself butt naked so I'm consistent cuz my clothes will all weigh a little bit different under 250 so we're good to go next upep I will come in here flip this light on and this is the garage where you guys have seen some dope pictures from Calvin I have a box set up right here with a shoe and this is my tripod and it's about there I stepped like a little bit under the light cuz this light is so hard harsh and then I do my posing right here not going to pose for you guys I give you guys a little quad Flex that's all you get but for now the POS is a secret do that and then I send the video to Honey with my weight pretty much every morning or at least every morning I actually POS and then normally a little lot of breath and like God damn open the garage for when I go do cardio come back in here and a little bit of Cafe Olay I just changed this up it's I was having raw burn this [ __ ] gets you lit up it has you himan only 150 Mig of caffeine which I love cuz I don't want to have too much caffeine but still makes you sweat and get you stemmed up but I'm kind of cutting that stuff out like 2.5 weeks AG as you guys saw from my f day eating I'm slowly picking away sweeteners that are like intense I'll still have like a tiny bit of my coffee if I want it but nothing quite that strong I guess you could say so I either torn these up way early before me she'll make a hot coffee sometimes but cold brew is also good cuz we're in Florida and after I POS in that garage I'm normally already a little bit sweaty and then to this I add been having these electrolyte samples again I piss through so much through the night that like I'm dehydrated in the morning obviously and these things are packed like there's a gram of sodium in here so I don't have nearly the whole thing a full one of these will ask me like in courtne like two or three drinks each all I do is sprinkle a little bit on like that it's chocolate flavored so if you're wondering why the [ __ ] putting electrolytes in there it's chocolate flavored and then I take corney's little fro there spin it up oh you're right it's thing it's kind of sad this stuff makes it easy anyway I could probably just Stir It stir it and we're good to go yeah normally I'd love to have some nut pods some like dairyfree sugar-free creamies and [ __ ] in there but obviously we're not having that right now so drink this super light chocolate taste but just gives a little flavor little electrolytes then I refill my water back up to the top grab my headphones and go start cardio so I'm just going to sip on my coffee and then I'll see you on the treadmill all right so these are my ugly ass cardio shoes have no I like to train in socks these are like the sock equivalent of a shoe almost there's like nothing to them no support super wide toe base right there so I can like my feet aren't crammed into a shoe and I have tried every which shoe Courtney just bought a new pair of as6 she tried New Balance all the [ __ ] I'm like yo just buy the barefoot shoes to new cardio your feet are not meant to be wrapped up in a tight squish like cushion shoe so this is what I rock for cardio and honestly it's helped my knees it's help my feet it's help my shins when I do a lot of cardio and I'm someone with really bad feet so that SVS a lot this is the chimo in the good old garage it's got a lot of buttons to start which is very annoying I have to look at all these fake happy faces staring at me on the pictures I typically start it incline 3% Speed 3 mph and take a T-shirt and the screen is like an iPad large and it's full brightness so I put a t-shirt over top two reasons brightest [ __ ] in my eyes in the morning second reason I don't want to see the time on it for as long as I can so I typically do this setting people always ask me this treadmill setting I typically do this and then I'll go up to a 6% incline and slowly in ramp my speed up to 3.4 3.5 mph and sometimes near the end I'll put up like 8 10% ink fine and really trying to like push through my glutes so that I'm walking I'm trying to squeeze my butt just to make sure I'm like getting the good old glute shredded also turn the fan on this thing is freaking hot in Florida some days and it gets brutal out here and then I just walk my ass out for about not about 45 minutes on the dot I get the [ __ ] off this thing in 45 minutes I'm not a cardio guy but I typically start headphones in I\nput on like a relaxing music and try and just like chill reflect sometimes I like what why why I'm drawing a bike right now Envision whatever the rest of my prep me going through Peak Week me backstage me getting on stage me doing this stuff and I like put myself Through the Motions like that and I kind of feel it all and experience it all and get myself like mentally prepared for it I don't do that a few time of the week sometimes I just sit here and think of like what's going on in my life reflect do like a a gratitude reflection random [ __ ] like that and then I'll go in check my emails reply to text blah BL blah blah I also forgot to mention when I go to sleep I put my phone on airplane mode at like I 9:00 at night so nothing can even come through I wake up nothing comes through no no notifications and it just stops my mind from having to think about anything until I'm on the treadmill and I choose to to get off airplane mode and check if I have anything going so if there like a stressful thing from work or an email or whatever I don't have to focus on it until I'm ready to focus on it and then I go through all that [ __ ] watch a show watch some YouTube kill time and then you'll see what happens after that so I'm going to crush this [ __ ] and enjoy it every second because who doesn't love cardio [Music] [Music] all right I can do that my absolute array of Health supplements currently take people probably going ask what I'm taking so I'm might as well just say as I'm going but I have K2 D3 kidney turmeric vitamin C a whole bunch of fish oils I know there's calories and fish oils but I've been having these every single day so my body is used to it take lipid the healthy cholesterol sodium bicarbonate this is actually supposed to be anti-cancerous want here but it also helps for kidneys and stuff it's kind of a Progressive Medical thing that good for your kidneys and then liver and heart he's calling me now this is breakfast that has to all be like 10 calories at least more than 10 calories there's like 10 omegas in there I do it every day if I had just added that in like a week out I add in like 100 calories from fish oils maybe that wouldn't be the best but my body e to it and I'm do wait doing it so we're doing it anyways just finished cardio 45 minutes wrapped it up honey called me I sent him videos and then he wanted to call me to go over a game plan now that we're like 2.5 weeks out stuff is changing very consistently he like do more cardio do less cardio post today instead of cardio eat this if it's chest day you know so fine tuning everything and change almost every day and luckily he talks a lot he can just rant on the phone so it's good when I'm on the treadmill because then I just can get through it and next thing I know it's like oh I've been walking for 45 minutes and we got a game plan and I'm ready to go and then sometimes I'm like con I'm rushing out the door I got to go man what is it but he's very technical and I mean we're 2.5 weeks up so I want technical I want everything locked in and even if sometimes coaches tell you to change stuff consistently they're really hot just to make you feel like you're doing more than than you are then that helps like if I'm like okay well if you told me to do this today and change that tomorrow like something's different every day just to kind of break up the monotony of the bodybuilding [ __ ] Groundhog Day sometimes it helps anyways just made my pancakes this morning I've been going back and forth in my morning routines between either making oats and eggs or blending it into pancakes I don't know why I just like switching it up sometimes I want to eat like two separate things that taste a little bit different sometimes I just want to eat a plate a thin watery egg white pancakes so today one of those days we're going to cook these pictures up and to Joy cuz I am freaking hungry right now [Music] [Music] these taste better than a hamburger in the offseason expect it it you starve yourself for 16 weeks eat these you'll enjoy it more than if you starve yourself for 16 weeks you'll eat dirt exactly it's but you get more enjoyment from it cuz you're deprived why deprivation is such a beautiful thing you rather get more joy from small things don't you rather have a burger instead no I rather earn something through deprivation but I wanted more have studio in the house today this is probably the epitome of how you don't want to live in prep cameras and lights on you but you're lucky I love you guys anyways final part is of my morning routine sometimes I cold tub briefly in the morning but lately I've been doing a Sonic cold tub later in the day so not toly morning routine but I've been stretching and rolling out a little bit I typically just roll out a little bit at the start just to like move some stuff through and then I stretch my my hips hip flexors a little bit just to get stuff like moving I feel like there's been like a trend lately of people being like foral doesn't do anything stretching doesn't do anything and there's been this trend of people like debunking everything that every everyone's ever done as a myth and saying like nothing works oh jeez having B but you know what anecdotally I have never stretched in the past and this year I've been stretching like five times a week in the morning my hips feel better my quads feel better my knees feel better I've been like less pain than I've been I can squat right now at 2 weeks out with no knee pain my stra sh Cuts everything and my legs are a little bit more Fuller a little bit deeper and when I get really like tight in my hip from doing so much\ncardio I actually start to feel like tired and exhausted it can even affect my digestion just like blood flow everything lymphatic drainage right babe yeah bab all that good stuff and it's helped me and anecdotally I feel better doing it so I'm going to continue to do it but I typically just roll through my quads a little bit like I said get stuff going and then I go over in my little carpet stretch area over there and stretch which I'll show you in a [Music] minute all right run through this a little quick show you guys I'm so Calvin and have to watch me stretch for 20 minutes but huge thing hip flexers tight on everyone definitely tight on me I like to find something that's like yay high put my foot on it lean forward like this and I'll like thrust my hips forward flex my glute of the foot that's up and kind of push through with my hip like a pelvic tilt pushing forward and you really feel like a tight stretch in here and I'll just kind of like move around like that sometimes I lean back I put my arm behind me and I'll feel it like all the way up here like this sometimes I sit into it a little bit deeper just let it pull in there and you just kind of find whatever spot feels really tight and when it hits I just hold that and I mean sometimes I'll literally like get into that part I'm watching a show doing something on my phone and I'll just sit there in that position for like a minute or something just really let it open up and I don't do this right before I train and do it like early in the morning and then I'm like 4 hours later I'm working out so if I'm doing legs or anything like that it's not like overly loose and I also do my hips glutes just sitting like this across my underneath me and this is when it always cracks through my hips and feels so good to release but I literally same kind of thing just push till you feel where you want to feel this is where I get my hip up in the hip chop socket joint in there loosen up a lot I feel it my glutes too especially if I lean forward like that damn I feel so good it really gets that [ __ ] out like that after that oh damn do a little bit of hamstering and stuff just like open my legs wide this is kind of my adductor groins too I try and just like crawl myself forward and like reach a few times and I push my feet out like this so that my toes are pointing outwards of my body not in and you feel that pull a little bit deeper in your groin here and you pull in there next for whatever reason a million ways to stretch every part of your body you literally have to figure out which way is best for you I like just sitting on a knee and I kind of have a slight Bend in my in my knee right here and this is for my hamstring and I can like rotate a little bit and pull my outer hamstring I can come in a little bit and get on my inner there and just just feel like you always just got to feel your body wherever you need it pull from that position sit in it when your body gets comfortable in there push a little bit deeper into it breathe through all your stretches and roll with it these are the main ones that I do sometimes I'll like line on my back pull my knees to my chest roll the side all that kind of good stuff but these are the main literal for that I do because my hips hamstring glutes and quad hip flexors are the tightest things on my body some days I'll stretch my lats just simply by like starting on something like this and pulling one at a time and just rolling through whatever I feel like I need to typically have a podcast on or even a show I'll set up over there and watch it and I do this for like 20 minutes max super easy and honestly some days if I'm like really tired and I feel exhausted beat up I'm just like oh [ __ ] this day after this I actually have more energy just like blood flow moving through your body letting the energy kind of flow through your body and it's a great way to start the day so you don't feel like a complete ass even though I still do anyways right now cuz I'm two weeks out so that's pretty much it for my morning routine I'll probably I take a cold shower after cold there's no real cold water the showers in Florida sadly but it is what it is I make it as cold as I can sometimes I dip in the cold tub like I said if I do in the morning it's only like 2 or 3 minutes typically do it longer later in the day with a sauna especially on rest days and it's about it probably not going to show you me getting in the shower cuz Kevin's seen enough of me naked more retanning at the oia kind of sus and you guys are very sus so I don't want to show you that so thank you guys for watching and I don't know what we're training after this but see you at the gym Jesus all right what's going on guys shoulder day I filming shoulders in a minute but I'm like 50 g carved deep right now and I'm feeling it warming up it's just literally trying to get energy moving through my body so I can actually feel my muscles and functioning pretty much refraining from 90% of free weights at least with like compound movements so I warm up the [ __ ] under of my shoulder I've done like four sets so far like 10 reps on this machine here about to get started on the working sets then we're going to move through some machine presses maybe some dumbbell raises and get through this beautiful shoulder workout because it's also one of those days where I have the worst [ __ ] protein farts so I tried to get them all out before I came here cuz no one wants that of the gym to hold it in but it's part of prep sadly and need a private gym for that soul purpose but I'll be holding it in cuz I don't want to [ __ ] embarrass myself in front of anyone here luckily it's a dead gym Calvin might be the one suffering [Music] [Music] B my knee in there had to pick\nmy legs up and walk right now but warm-ups lately honestly been doing a little bit more well you normally like 3 to four serve my energy but right now I'm really trying to get my blood moving flowing and I'm not hitting any PR they're doing really heavy sets right now so I'm trying to like burn calories blood flow warm up properly not hurt myself it's easier to hurt yourself the dryer Le get too so taking a slow just trying to not lose all my size [Music] well you don't check your phone you're going to work out honey texted me he's like how many carb meals do you have left today I was like just one he's like okay cut all your carbs I was like sick I guess I'm having zucchini and fish post workout a dream come true no more carbs for the rest of the day time to get [ __ ] shredded boys this is two weeks out and time to suffer time to deplete suffer and just nap and work out and survive so it's game time [Music] [Music] track my water on these liter water bottles I just like strike on them but it makes me drink more water cuz I'm tracking for whatever reason I have to piss all the time in the only bathroom in the opposite corner of the gym has the machines I'm just like too L to walk over there I hold my piss half the workout there piss herself so P show start wearing diaper yeah bum diapers come up new line of bum pull-ups that you wear at the gym so you don't have to go pee [Music] you think you need you [Music] the one thing about being good or good Jesus being weak right now is I can use this machine I [ __ ] love this machine but it's just way too light there's Flex Fitness shoulder presses that have flight loaded this one's pin loed and that's full stack right there and I just control the way and push typically my offseason I can't use it but I'm weak right now I don't feel like loading up bunch of plates such in truck out there and I was like what the [ __ ] uh yeah that's all I got to say nice to be weak for this one reason [Music] that's [Music] [Music] you [Music] [Music] free weights all I'm doing is accessories really right now so I did three sets shoulder press three sets pin load of shoulder press now I'm going to do probably two sets laterals two sets front raises move on with some re dels probably going to be it for shoulders but I want to give a shout out to flex to for the T-shirt he just randomly sent me a box with some dragon lir t-shirts and then this one which is like a custom cut and sew shirt and it's like a little bit longer no hate on flex but this would be an absolute dress on you but I like it cuz I love long kind of oversized t-shirts so I don't know if he's building a brand or not but if he is stay tuned cuz I got a shirt in the mail it doesn't safe Dragon there or Flex on so thanks Flex love you see you in a week [Music] [Music] [Music] skinny [ __ ] don't be skinny [ __ ] or # skinny [ __ ] big difference in your verbage but I'm a skinny [ __ ] I [Music] [Music] ch [Music] I going to tweak it for my last set [Music] either what I call hone calls the [ __ ] slap redel flies do with the best with a metal cable a metal handle so it locks your wrist in position instead of pulling like this which I'm doing for the next exercise you kind of do like a [ __ ] slap motion and I I like do it high pulling down a little bit I feel it more into my like mid rear Dell rather than into my traps at all feels good I don't know whatever you get your best mod connection with rear Dells is one of those finicky things you got to play with it feels good to me so give it a shot thank you yeah thank you sadly this gym only has one PE deck so I'm just waiting to do reverse flies on that but I was going to wrap up today with a little bit of triceps and I don't feel like waiting doing nothing so finishing not finishing replacing my finisher or whatever I don't know what I'm saying doing these cable crossover things been doing these this prep feel very good on my triceps isolated movement I hit my tricep a little bit through shoulders so I just kind of Polish them off a little bit here cuz I'm not going to be training arms for 3 days so I figured might as well get a little extra in there and then I think whenever I think this gu done on the back deck I'm going to seal that finish there long as someone else doesn't take it from me little ABS little cardio go home eat zero carbs thanks to honey do it all again tomorrow this is part of those workouts where I'm just like dying but I'm going to make Calin film this because people say I don't do abs so Calvin no every time I go to train ABS he just leaves the gym and everyone's like you train ABS Chris I'm like no Calvin just doesn't like filming to do abs you don't do abs okay so I don't do abs very intense but this is the first year I've actually trained abs and I know I have proof because I don't cramp I used to do three four five reps and just cramp about I couldn't do anymore now I can do three four five sets and not die so the Plus for me I don't know if it's going to translate on stage they look that different right now have a little bit better abdominal control but I don't do any like weighted crunches heavy machinery none of that [ __ ] I was doing more like body weight crunches and like leg lifts and different variations throughout my prep but now that I'm at the end and I'm honestly just dead at the end of my work I just do straight leg raises into knee tuck and do like four five sets nothing crazy almost failure not quite and then call it a day that's all it takes one set a year no I do that I try and get 10 straight leg 10 knee tuck my first set or so and then the rep slowly dwindle down I don't get any body pumped right now not I'm going to pump anywhere so depleted and\nmy abs get pumped I don't know why it's not a good feeling it's not what you want but hopefully have a better midsection on stage this year have you ever bent over and just like your top AB cramps bro I [ __ ] just I have to stand like this and just lean backwards slightly and or otherwise they all cramp it looks in like a lock it looks like I have a hernia like sticks out cuz the whole pack like contraction sticks out miserable [Music] is do I have abs GH got [ __ ] Deb Flex that GH cut yeah I'm Miss natti's liver King bro gotcha back on the St give me wrap on this workout though hope you guys enjoyed my morning routine my morning ritual my shoulder day my

    "text": "Direction, Role Models, and a High?Volume Shoulders & Arms Day ? Transcript \nChris Bumstead (CBum) ? Cleaned transcript provided by user \nI got a DM the other day from this kid and he was asking me, not really asking me, but declaring that he felt lost. He had no direction in life. He's 20 years old. He sees me. I seem to have a clear path of where I'm headed and he doesn't know what to do. And it really got me thinking about a lot of things cuz let me be clear, when I was 20 years old, I had no idea what the ? I was doing either. But it really got me thinking about a lot of avenues of I've heard that a lot. You know, I've had a lot of conversations with people at events or DMs or whatever it may be of people saying things like this, and it's not a rare occurrence. And I feel like every generation has had their fair share of challenges. In the past, I feel like it was a little bit more physical obvious ones like war, poverty, disease, crazy ? which I know still exists in the dark world currently. But by and large, I feel like America as a whole on average, the younger generation, their problem isn't finding comfort in hard times, but in avoiding too much comfort and too much pleasure. And I feel like the odds are heavily stacked against the younger generation because I mean, first of all, there's billions and billions and billions of dollars of research going into how to make a phone, social media, anything highly, highly addictive. And we're given that giving kids those at like 8 years old. They have them in school, bring them around everywhere in their pocket. Social media is creating these like crazy role models of like do drugs, party, look cool, chase after girls, do all this ? And it's like absolutely absurd in my opinion. And I think the ability to abstain from doing the easy, pleasurable thing that's right in front of you and picture a life that you can dream of, asking yourself if a better version of yourself exists. what that version of yourself is. Picturing the plan to get there and actually starting and executing on that plan, I think is such a rare thing right now and so hard for people to stop and even think about given how much constant distraction there is in their life. And that's what made me want to ask this kid. I was like, do you believe a better version of yourself exists? And I'll get into that. But I really, this really got me thinking a lot about role models. Like the idea of a role model and thinking about how when I was young, I had everything so wrong. And I didn't really have a role model in my life helping me. Don't get me wrong, my dad was incredible, but he wasn't really like in my face on my case in my job knowing what I was doing. He was from a different generation. He wasn't close to my age or hadn't recently gone through anything I was going through. And I, full transparency, was just a dumb kid. I thought it was cool to party, to not try in school, to do drugs, to chase after girls, to do all these things. My friends literally thought it was cool to like, and it's funny cuz my brain is still kind of wired to be like, \"Yeah, it's fun.\" You know, of course it is. And people probably listen probably feel the same way, but to like think of going out and drinking and chasing after girls with no like connection or value for who the person is. To not value your education when you're sitting there doing it. To be wasting my time with an education of which I didn't even know where it was leading me cuz I didn't think about what I wanted my future to be. I was just following the path that was put in front of me. To have all these things in front of me that I didn't have someone looking at me and being like, \"Do you want to be like a better man? Do you want to be a man period?\" Because what I was doing was what boys do, you know, like playing video games and chasing after girls, thinking it's cool to do all these things rather than building meaningful relationships, working on my making myself a better, well-rounded, more educated man to be prepared for taking care of a family and being the man that a woman that I\nrespect would want to even be with. You know, I didn't have anyone kind of in my face being like, \"What the ? do you want to do with your life? Who do you want to be with your life?\" asking me if I wanted to be exceptional. You know, if you ask the average kid, do you want to be exceptional? Do you want to do something great with your life? The answer is usually yes. But their actions very rarely align with it. And I feel like I didn't have anyone. And you don't need someone. The responsibility lies within yourself ultimately always. But I do believe that like a role model could be a huge asset for pushing yourself to ask these hard questions and being like if you want to be exceptional, what you're doing right now is average or even below average. And if you want to continue to be average or below average your whole life, then continue doing this. But you need to make a serious change and start doing hard ? and letting go of the easy ? the comfortable, pleasurable ? Abstain from that to make a better version of yourself. I didn't have someone really asking me that. And it's kind of a it's kind of scary now that like social media because we don't have role models in a real life. So many people I believe and now social media is such a vast array of like who do we look up to? The one with the most followers. You're young. You get on social media. If at that time the realm you fall into it is people who are promoting gambling, sex, drugs. And I'm it sounds like trit to even say those words, but people are literally like smoking weed, promoting gambling and talking about how to get girls, how to sleep with girls casually on social media. And I really think as a whole, all those things hurt men more than they benefit them. It doesn't make you cool. It just kind of takes away from values, genuine real values in life. So essentially trying not to ramble too much. This kid asked me that question in the many times I've been asked. It really got me just thinking about wanting to share that when I was young I had no idea what the ? I was doing and I didn't have a role model and falling into the wrong role model can get yourself into a bad position. But someone being able to ask you what do you want with your life? Do you believe a better version of yourself exists? And take responsibility to take that in action. And the reason that question to ask yourself is do you believe a better version of yourself exists? Is because if you say yes, you are admitting that you have faith. You have faith that a better version of yourself exists. And the only way to move forward in life is by starting and just taking action. There's no book or 12step program or perfect way that it's going to organize things. And this sounds super trait to say. I know everyone knows that, but people still don't do it. Awareness doesn't mean anything. Action is all that matters. But what do you need for action? Sometimes people like, \"What do I need for action?\" Well, you need faith. And if you believe a better version of yourself exists, then you already have faith. So, as a young man, speaking to most young men, you need to have faith a better version of yourself exists. You need to take responsibility for your own life into your own hands. Most likely, you're not going to have a role model following you, telling you what to do, asking you these hard questions, and pushing in the right direction. You need to be the one to do that. So, where the ? do you start? easiest thing to do. Look in your life. See the things that are easy that everybody is doing. What's what in your life is like calls towards you that you can just feel as a vice when you're checking your phone all the time, playing video games, eating shitty food, doing all things. What calls to you that makes you want to do that everyone else is also called to and avoid those things. And just by avoiding those things, you are already going to be ahead of everyone else who's stuck into those things. And then being able to sit down and clearly define the values that are important to you. You can start with like an ideal person that you want to be defining those values. Actually think about that strictly. Like if you say you're going to do something, do it. Be a man of your word. You're not going to succumb to the easy pleasures. You're going to value delayed gratification over easy gratification. You're going to be respect every single person that you meet. You're not\ngoing to lie. You're not going to ? You're going to work hard. If you're going to do something, you're going to do it with intention rather than halfassing it and just being like, \"Oh, at least showing up's half the job.\" like you need to declare how you want to show up into the world and then stick to those things and just start taking action. And the first bit of action sometimes is just removing the pleasures, starting to do some hardship. And that's also why I really love the gym because the gym requires discipline. Choosing what you put in your mouth versus what you don't put in your mouth requires discipline. Going to the gym when you're tired and working hard requires discipline. And when you show your mind what your body can do by doing hard things and the progress that comes from that, it gives you a bit of momentum where you can start to see and think about things more clearly and start applying that same discipline to other areas of your life. None of it might make sense in the beginning, but I truly believe if you're at least trying to define your values, if you get them wrong, they'll evolve. If you create a path for yourself and you go the wrong way, you will still learn and then you can create a new path from what you've learned there. But if you're just sitting down absorbing comfort constantly and not taking action, you're going to go absolutely nowhere. So realize that you already have faith in yourself. Take responsibility for your own life cuz no one's going to take it for you. Define who you want to become, the values that are going to get you there. And just start by doing something. That's all I got to say. And then the rest will come. I promise you, if you guys actually put the right effort into it and you're not spending your time absorbing ? the rest will come. With all that being said, my AC is starting to dial me in this car and I'm getting the ? hot as ? out and I'm sitting outside my gym ranting before going to workout. So, it's shoulders and arms. It's beautiful Saturday. I might have some French toast after this workout. So, if you bear with me through this rant, let's go out. All right, so I don't know how long I just ranted in the car. So, let me jump into this workout. I'm still doing really high volume giant sets. built a bunch of strengths doing a ? ton of volume. This is why programming is so important. I really think like the biggest cheat code of training is having proper periodization to not plateau where you can hit different stimuluses so that the body can the muscle can keep getting different stimuluses, continue to grow, not hit plateaus. I said I wasn't going to rant and here I go. So, shoulders and arms today. I got a giant set to start with a bunch of Oh, wow. This is going to be a lot. Damn. Shoulder giant set, tricep giant set, bicep giant set. Wish me luck. Come on. Come on. Come on. Yeah. Okay. All right. I have no idea if you can hear me because the fans are loud. I don't give a ? It's hot as hell. That was the first giant set for shoulders. All those exercises were back to back to back. No rest. Just as soon as you can get into it, you go. I took like a little bit of rest between the last two um prone lateral raises just because they were the same movement. I gave myself like 5 10 seconds and then blasted into it. Moving on to triceps now. This split currently I have a chest and tricep day, a back and bicep day, and a shoulders and arms day. So, I'm getting a good amount of volume in my arms. Trying to not have these skinny arms. I feel like genetically the first muscle I lose is my arms, which sucks being retired cuz like all you really need are calves and arms, but it is what it is. At least I have some calves sometimes. So, moving on to tricep. Same thing. Fore superset. Got my favorite tricep exercise in here. Well, close to the decline dumbbell skull crusher. The decline cable easy bar skull crusher. Mouthful. Probably one of my favorite tricep exercise of all time. Dumbbell is a close close call. Very similar movement. So, going to jump into this starting with the dip machine right behind me and I'll take you guys through it. Okay. Yeah. All [Music] right. So, wrapped up the tricep portion. Just by the way, I'm doing three rounds of all of these giant sets. So, 4 * 3 is 12 * 3 is 36. I'm not good at math, but 36 working sets in this workout. And obviously given that they're supersets, they're not at full intensity of which I were to take 60 to 90 seconds in between. So the\ncapacity is less of course, but still it's a ? ton of volume into the arms right now. And this isn't something to do all the time. There's an intention that this is part of the program for like two weeks. This is blasting in high carbs in my diet the next couple weeks and then back to regular programming. So, with that being said, going to jump into biceps. I don't have a proper preacher curl flat bench, so I'm going to try and not hit my arms here. Lock it in and get the rest of my arms pumped. Oh yeah. [Music] Hey, Thank you. still a skinny ? but that's okay. Just wrapped up this quite high volume workout with a success. This was like a This is a pure Saturday workout. If you love volume, if you love lifting weights, and you want to get in 36 sets of arms, this is a beautiful way to do it on a Saturday, cuz there's no other time where you have enough time to do this kind of ? And if you're lucky enough that your gym is actually slow enough to do that many giant sets, then God bless. That's probably the biggest restraint when it comes to public gyms. But that's why when we were doing a lot of the programs in standard, we had to a few of the programs have some pretty extensive supersets in them, but we minimized them as much as possible, understanding that most people aren't in a rather empty gym. So, with all that being said, I've been here for way too long. Bradley's nap is about to wrap up and it's Saturday, so it's family time. So, going to head home, get some food in me, fuel up on carbs because I need those to shuttle into my biceps so I'm not a skinny ? anymore. That's it. What are you making, dude? Making you some sourdough French toast with turkey bacon. There you go, my love. Hit it. All right, so post-workout French toast. Courtney's famous French toast. We haven't started a tradition yet because Bradley's not old enough, but hopefully one day our kids are old enough where they can just eat whatever dad wants on a Sunday morning and this can be what we do. So, couple pieces of sourdough, French toast, cuz sourdough is a goat, turkey, bacon, and then whatever that stuff is, coconut whipped stuff. So, probably not a lot of protein in here, but it's all right cuz I had with a shake for breakfast, so we're balancing it out. And it tastes delicious. So, going straight to the arms today. Make that workout worth it. Damn. Byebye."

    "text": "Transcript ? High Carb Day, Leg Day & Recovery Vlog \nGenerated on November 03, 2025 \nwhat is up YouTube living life right now high carb day that's not my meal though sadly that's not on diet but this is the new Savage Bowl ground bison sweet potato hash avocado Mayo mix with ketchup and mustard like Big Mac Secret Sauce delicious and we got beautiful new six-pack boxes for the bum box so Calvin's eating like a champion and I'm trying to be a champion so with that being said I do have a little bit of a higher carb day today we're rolling and prep it's pretty much rolling with the punches going with the flow as things are especially at this point we're 2 and a half weeks out right now so I typic I don't typically I send honey my weight every single morning maybe every other day every three days I send a check-in in the morning every now and then I check in after my workout and given how flat I look how much my weight's dropping it all depends on what I'm going to eat that day so I have a base diet which right now is a little bit less than that full day evening I think I'm down to like 180 of carbs a little bit maybe just sub 2,000 calories or so with my base diet and my weight dropped like a pound 2 days in a row so we're like all right eat a little bit more food and see how your body responds to that plus it's leg day today so I'm getting a little bit more nutrients in me but it's nothing crazy it's like instead of 50 grams of carbs in a meal I get 75 gam of carbs get steak pre-workout I get salmon before bed so a little extra fat little extra carbs a little extra fun stuff but this is the thing H used to give me [ __ ] for saying everything that I did in my prep and everything we did and how I ate and all all this stuff and I was like it doesn't matter because there's no [ __ ] plan that someone else can follow and do this it's all just nuanced going with the flow reading how the body follows understanding what my body's done in the past how it's changing this year and all these things and just making adjustments as we go so you really got to learn your body over time have a coach who knows what the [ __ ] he's doing and adapt as time comes so with that being said I got to make my pre-workout meal you're not a fan of macros I'm not a big fan of if if it's your Macros in bodybuilding prep because the more you can control every single variable then you change one variable and you know what that change does whereas if you're getting different nutrients different sugars different sodium levels all these different preservatives all this [ __ ] in random food or your body doesn't know how it's going to digest even potato versus rice when you're eating at certain times a day it just changes things and you don't know what different potatoes different potatoes there's the rhyen reason behind all the potatoes but yeah I like eating the same thing every single day so I know exactly how my body responds and when I make a change I know what the change is causing so I atat the same thing every day but if I wasn't prepping to be Mr Olympia would I do If It Fits your Macros no but I would eat healthy If It Fits your Macros so if I wanted to have like healthy banana bread instead of rice one day I would just do it cuz I don't give a [ __ ] I'm not trying to win Olympia but I'm trying to win a six Olympia so we're locked in was that technique implemented where Courtney put your chicken in bong beginning of this prep I think I I think it started as convenience cuz it's easier to slow cook like 10 packs of chicken at once than anything else and it ended up tasting really good I enjoyed it it stayed fresher longer stayed moist longer if I'm allowed to use that word in the fridge and then it tastes good to reheat so pretty much all my chicken these here has been slow cooked and it's a BM broth and # delicious not as good as\nsteak though can't deny that all right love you bye bye by right there's definitely protein powder in that funnel that I just put a y in but that's all right we'll have some I think it was may have been the Frosted animal Frenchie cracker protein and some watermelon EA delicious intro all right I'm moving really slow today but those extra carbs are giving me energy I can feel it so I'm GNA try and move some weight today probably the last second last properly heavy leg day it's hamstring dominant not quad so nothing crazy but still try to keep the weights up heavy today not be skin pitch sh well the carbs are certainly working today amazing what extra 100 gr of carbs 15 20 G of fat can do still

to make it a little easier to get a bunch of carbs in me CU I'm an open bodybuild now I got to shove them down cuz I'm [ __ ] huge uh yeah we're hitting a little bit of back a little bit of posing little upper body it's Thursday so I'm barely going to train go home and eat a bunch more food so I'll get this workout done then show you guys what we're eating later tonight what he said muffins not today maybe tomorrow might get some muffins tomorrow oh man down down down down or what tomorrow the muffins are coming how many muffins how many you going to tell me to eat or how many am I going to eat how many are you going to eat oh God we don't know yet depends how many my stomach can fill up got to be more than chag D there's no Costco Costco Costco mu bro European bakeries I mean I do agree they're probably that's it that's it see how better you thought I'm so skinny right do I feel heavy no okay just trying get 12 relax chest up F obviously there's no we cap so we don't have to worry about weighing in so that has a huge difference and now what we're going to do is really try to com combine his conditioning with bit more fullness so we can get more of a 3D look on stage so that's what the goal is so it's a different look than what we were chasing before and then also the timing is going to be a lot different because now we have to double Peak because this show has prejudging 800m on Saturday and then 24 hours later the other 50% of the judging is going to be done on Sunday evening so we have to go in looking great and then keeping it for the next night so there's a lot of differences between these shows I have to say the biggest difference though is what's already happened I didn't have to make weight today so we weren't struggling I was 245 I was in shape I look good I didn't have to cut water I could eat more food when I'm 245 I look good but then we got to get down to 241 to make weight so the difference is before and now it's still just make sure I'm leaning full yeah so ideal look is what a bit bigger try to keep as much conditioning as close to what you had Olympia but a bit bigger is that that's the all these words mean they have no Jed definition but you spend enough time in bodybuilding and like Fuller versus bigger versus dry leer you know they're all different you can do a row there's two different rowing machines there's this one which doesn't actually feel bad at all good and then there's also like a hammer style one I saw both\nlike that feels good come on Chris bring that scapula back there you go good good keep going squeeze squeeze

doors open we're in Czech Czech Republic they call it now czechia say check check say ches I piss off on yeah I'm not going to say that and it's cold out doors are open they got a fan on me and I'm naked getting sprayed down with cold water that's why I'm cold right now but hopefully I dry quick let we get the hell out of here e some muffins we're rolling let me take a look backstage last spray T never it's my last spray T this is stuff I won't this part's are fun sometimes especially with Kelly Kelly's a goat with protan but shaving pre-shaving and stuff sitting in the shower for 2 hours a day just bicking your body away not going to miss that no more baby dolphin Christopher be a hairy [ __ ] Woodsman So Good Times the last for everything unless there was a comeback why you decided to do this I've been talking about doing this for years okay almost every year after the Olympia look to see if there's an open show close by in Florida or something or even in the US and there hasn't been been one and this year there still wasn't one and I'm like [ __ ] it if I'm ever going to do it this is the only time I can ever do it so I found one in Europe and was talking to Martin one day about it he's like if you do it I'll do it and I wanted to compare myself to a top pro at some point and just see without trying without putting on the weight just my classic physique look beside an open Pro look and he said he would do it so I was like screw it why not yeah he didn't know at the time he was going to be a top four look that's even better yeah yeah I knew he was going to do well but top four is even better yeah had a bunch of moments leading into this being like why am I still dieting but then I'm like it's 3 weeks and for the rest of my life I'm going to be like what would they looked like beside one of those guys you know you can crop beside each other but it's just not the same so living with no regret I saw a cool clip of a an F1 race and it was someone against Alonzo and he was like his the quote over top of it was he has a wife and daughter at home I knew he was going to break and he just sent it into the corner and the other guy break and he passed him and won the race and it's like different times and different parts of your life you know are you trying to win the race or are you trying to live your life with what you care about you know were there part of me with 5 years ago that might have done it or if I was alone and single might have done it maybe that's not what I want in my life right now you know I'd rather break into that corner and go home to my wife and kids I still feel like I lived that though you know like the last 5 years I haven't breaken break in any Corner they were just doing it you know I've lived my life and\nnow I get the other side of it so I don't feel like I'm missing anything you 100% have to when they do like the pose down you have to come off stage off stage and just like go on the crowd of maybe yeah never done that once in I did I multiple guest posings yeah that's guest POS this is the show to do this is it whenever they do that pose down it's like 30 seconds go by and then you're like all right I can only do this for so long Calvin knows from many asking you many question you ever asked me what's my favorite what's the most what's the number one I can't answer it what will you miss what will I miss in general yeah it doesn't have to be the most the Simplicity the daily purpose like the moments where I'm taking a nap and it has a purpose you know I'm resting and it has a purpose I'm doing nothing all day and eating and going to the gym and getting to bed betterly and there's the purpose to it you know there's no purpose to that anymore I'm not it's not making me better at something just a simple like progress which I'll really miss and obviously the community around competing like the week before and you know it's it's something that brings people together for a a purpose you know like we wouldn't all just hang out get every be in Prague or even at the Olympia we all wouldn't just be in the Trump Hotel hanging out doing [ __ ] like it's always an event where people come together and it's a reason to be excited to like get emotional to connect and do things and you know gonna have to find something else a trip and vacation is one thing but like an event that's like people know that they care about you and you tied a lot of like sacrifice and emotion into it it just leads to More Beautiful Moments memories there a lot of things I'll miss a lot I won't right though I feel like whenever I I don't enjoy going on vacation a few more setup shots before we go you ready walking around like his just on the [Laughter] what's up how are you man good brother how

    "text": "Bulking ? Video Transcript \nSource: User-provided transcript \nPrepared on 2025-10-26 \nNotes \nThis document is a cleaned, formatted transcript based on the text you provided. Section headers were inferred heuristically from short title-like lines (e.g., questions such as ?How Do I Know When to Bulk??).\nIntro \nWhat is up, YouTube? Today, I'm going to be going over the top questions people ask me on how to bulk. Any questions I get towards bulking, I've kind of compiled in like a top 10, and I'm going to be going going over all of them today so you have them in a concise area pretty much based off my experience rather than just purely science-based stuff. It's everything I've done and learn from my mistakes throughout the years, so you guys can learn from what I've done right and done wrong and hopefully learn faster than I did. First \nHow Do I Know When to Bulk? \nquestion is always, how do I know when to bulk? And I find this such a funny question people ask me cuz I have no [beep] clue when people should bulk. It's very like situation dependent, person dependent, goal dependent. But as a whole, I would say obviously if your goals put on muscle, you should bulk. And if you're not fat, you can bulk. And fat is obviously very different to the average person. But if you're unhappy with the level of body fat you're at, that's super important. I don't think you should bulk yet. Come down to a body fat that you're happier with, maybe a little bit below even, and then work your way back up. But as a general rule of thumb, I like to be like around 12% body fat for men, maybe 18 to 20 for women, but having visible abs for men specifically, it's easier to gauge. So if my abs are still poking through a little bit, then I'm good to go and I know I haven't bulked too far or I'm good to bulk. Next question, tail off \nHow Do I Know When to Stop Bulking? \nthat last one, is how do I know when to stop bulking? And similar to when you know if you should bulk, if you start to lose your abs or if you get too much of a high body fat percentage, I always struggled to say that. I got it that time. Then you know it's time to slow down. There's a few other things like when your appetite is absolutely like in this [beep] like you can't eat at all. It'll be tough to eat when you're bulking really hard. One is completely gone. Sometimes you need to just take a step back. If your lifts in the gym are plateauing, if your weight is stagnating, all these different things, it's kind of time to give your body a little bit of a break, whether it be for a week or a full cut. It kind of depends on your goals and situation, of course. But again, big thing is if you have some abs, you're still happy with how you look, you're not too fat yet, then you can keep pushing that weight. All right. \nMacronutrient Essentials \nSo, how to start? How to start your base calories, macros, meal plan, whatever it may be. The simplest thing and that everybody needs to do in the suggestions quote is he always says what isn't measured isn't managed. So, the more you measure, the more you can manage, the more you can adapt and you know what changes you're making are causing the changes in your body. So, the most important step of starting anyone's fitness journey really is tracking everything you eat consistently and calculate the calories and macros on that. Maybe do it for a week, take the average and see what it is and weigh yourself during all those days as well. So, if I'm 250 lbs, I'm eating 4,000 calories every single day. Then my base to maintain 250 lb is 4,000 calories. So, if I want to lose weight, I'll go under that. If I want to gain weight, I'll go over that. Typically, you'll increase by like 5 to 10, probably like 5%, I would say. I usually go on more so like 300 to 500 calorie increase when I start a bulk. So, if I'm resting at 4,000, I'll go up to 4500. And then from there, you count your macros through that. Obviously, most important if\nPROTEIN \nyou're trying to bulk put on muscle is protein. And you don't need quite as much protein when you're bulking because carbs are actually protein sparing. When you're really low carb, your body is going to use protein for energy. Whereas, when you're really high carb, you have all the carbs to use for energy. So, your body uses the protein to build muscle. Therefore, they're like they help you spare protein. So, when you're in a low low carb deficit, your body's pulling from your protein source in order to make energy, not just rebuild. You need to add more protein to make sure that you're actually rebuilding properly as well as getting the energy from it. So, I stick to a minimum of 1 g per pound of body weight. Everyone knows that number. It's so simple. Just stick to it. Make sure you're at least hitting that. And that's what you prioritize. So, then you take that. I'm 250 lb. That's 250 g of protein with four calories for every gram of protein. So, multiply that by four. you're already at 1,000 calories. And then if I'm trying to hit 4,000 calories total, then I'm going to take 20 to 30% of that total caloric intake and make that into fat. And so whatever that is in fat, I'm not that quick at math. What is that? 20% of 4,000 200 800 800 quick math. So that would be 800 calories for me in fat. So then I have 1,000 calories of protein, 800 calories of fat, and then I just fill the rest with carbs. And then there's your macros right there. That's literally how simple it is. And the most important thing is to continue to track going forward. Make sure those are hidden with right. Track your body weight. Look at yourself in the mirror. Monitor your lifts. If things are moving in the direction you're happy with, just keep doing it. That's what's important. If you start to lose weight or you're not gaining weight fast enough, you add a little bit more calories. And then you keep those ratios the exact same. You can play with that. A lot of people do better with higher carb or higher fat. And you kind of rotate through. Typically, most people do that 20 30% fat. That's what's worked best for me. I enjoy eating a lot of carbs, not crazy amounts of fat, but also as I get to the end of my bulk and I'm eating like 6,000 calories, I'll start to just cover things in olive oil just because I need anything to get those calories in. So, obviously, there's a place to start, but the number one thing in being successful at anything is knowing that you're not stuck between these confines. If it works for you, it works for you. That's all that matters. Doesn't matter if someone else tells you what to do. If I do it or not, works for you, you're making muscle. The other thing to take note when you're counting your protein, the 1 g per pound of body weight, is there are some extreme cases where when people are really like underweight, like if you weigh 100 lb and you're a male and you're tall and you're just really skinny, you might want to bump that up from the beginning. And if you're heavily overweight, so you're 400 lb and you don't have that much muscle on you, you don't need 400 g of protein. If you can eat it, I guarantee you, you will lose weight more efficiently having more protein rather than fats or carbs in your diet. but it's not necessarily for putting on muscle. So, if it's too hard to eat, 400 grams of protein, that's a lot of protein, then bump that down to something that's a little bit more appropriate. What you would guess your lean body mass would be and then use that number. It's an estimate. Again, doesn't matter. You kind of play with things as they go. If you're really overweight losing weight, all that really matters is that your calories are below what your basil basil metabolic rate is. All right. Next question is \nWhat Type of Food Should I Be Eating? \nwhat type of food to eat? Cheat meals, clean bulk, or dirty bulk. Rule of thumb for this in my absolute belief is whole foods are the most important thing. Something that grows from the earth, something that caveman could eat, anything like that, single ingredient foods are your best bet. This is because I mean it's just normal food. Much easier for your body to digest. The more food you can digest and the nutrients you can actually absorb from it, the less you actually need to eat to get the same benefit out of it. The less you have to digest, better your stomach feels, the more\nyou can eat. It's all just like a feedback loop to making more gains essentially. And even eating bad food causes inflammation in the gut, which slows everything down, slows your bulk down, your muscle gain down, cause inflammation in your joints, can start hurting you when you're in the gym training. There's a cascade of effects that can come from that. Not to mention that it's just not as healthy for you. So, yes, we're trying to put on muscle, but the healthiest way to do it is often also the best way to do it. So, make sure you're actually focusing on eating clean whole foods and not just going after like a nasty, dirty goal. People \nWhat About Cheat Meals? \nalways ask about cheat meals. Why can I have cheat meal? I want a cheat meal. What's the point of cheat meals? All these things. And over the last like four or five years of my preps, I didn't get any cheat meals. And that was because of what I was talking about before. I didn't want that like gut digestion mess up. I didn't want the inflammation from it. I didn't want to ruin my sleep that night cuz I was full of all this [beep] and have my joints hurt the next day. Everything I was doing was so calculated to be the best that I was like, m I could have a cheat meal calorically and not get too fat, but it's going to have this other, you know, effects on my recovery, my digestion that's just not worth it right now. So, I didn't have those ever when I was in prep. In my off season, I like to live live a little bit. I still eat really healthy though. Like if I go to get a burger, sometimes I get a lettuce wrap, no cheese, cuz I know it's going to mess with my stomach and I make sure I stick with that. But again, it kind of depends on what your goals are. The only point of having a cheat meal is pretty much for your mental sake. If you need like a little bit of like stress relief or a break from it and if that's going to help you, then absolutely it's worth it. Even if you're a professional bodybuilder and it's going to benefit your mind and calm you down and give you a nice like cortisol brief to eat a cheat meal, then go for it. It's not the end of the world. But as me trying to be as the best in the world, I wasn't going to do that [beep] I was like, \"Fuck it. I'm going to fill up on good food, food I know I can digest, just eat more of that, still sleep good, digest good, and be better for it.\" But that like 01% change it's going to make doesn't matter to most people. And even now as a retired bodybuilder, I'd be less tricked on doing something like that myself. So Clean Bulk vs. Dirty Bulk why would you clean bulk versus dirty bulk? I would say people with dirty bulk are just people who don't understand the indepth like minutia of how important every little thing is to your body. So I just think it's just kind of the easy way out. I need to get some calories in. I'm going to throw some shitty food down. It's also a very like a band-aid. The short-term solution for a long-term goal that you have. You just do that for a year, 2 years, even 5 years from 20 to 25. Maybe you'll get away with if you're lucky, but it will start to catch up on you. So, I just don't even recommend dirty bulking. Throw in your cheat meals if you really want them and need them. But clean bulking is the way to go. We're not just trying to get jacked. You want to take care of your body. And when you build that healthy relationship with food that you're nourishing your body, you're fueling your body. You're putting good food in your body because you care about your body. It also makes it easier to diet because then you're not craving shitty foods when you're dieting because food isn't just like a obsessive I can have now or can't have it now. It's actually something that you appreciate and you're putting good things in your body. And when I switched that mindset of eating for health rather than just like restricting now or eating as much as I can now and I was like, no, I'm putting good food to take care of my body. When I started prepping, I didn't even crave shitty food anymore. I was like, I want a little more rice and chicken, but like it is what it is. I'm dieting. And it made it much easier for me. Just a little mindset switch. As I said, it's so case dependent and bulking. Like when I was a 21year-old trying to put on as much muscle as possible. I remember putting on like 20 or 30 lbs one offseason, probably more than that. And I\nwas like 270 plus lbs. Midday. I was like 275ish. And I dieted down to 220. And I was like eating shitty food, messing up my digestion. Didn't care cuz I was 21 years old and I was just pushing things. And that variance made it really hard for me. So I stopped doing that. So this is kind of again back to when you should stop bulking. If you're a bodybuilder, you really only need to go like 10% over your weight. So, I started being 20 lbs over my competing weight, which made it much easier for me to come back and down and make that weight and not stress my body out too much. It made my bulking way more efficient. But I had also been doing that for a decade. So, when you're at the beginning of your career, things are different. And this is why I always say, don't just listen to what I say. Kind of just take knowledge in and try things out for yourself and see what works best for you at this point in your journey. Cuz what works for me won't necessarily work for you. When I was young, I could dirty bulk, do all the things. Same with you guys when you're young and get away with these things. When I had to eat six almost 7,000 calories sometimes, I threw in some dirty food cuz at the end of the day, I just couldn't eat another bowl of chicken rice. I was just over it. I'd have a protein shake, peanut butter and jelly, go to bed, and just it is what it is. Now that I'm 30 years old and I'm a little older, my turn is good, digestion is good, everything is clean food, and you got to be a little bit more strict. But luckily, because I had more muscle mass on me, I didn't have to eat as much food. So, I was actually eating way more food when I was younger than I am now because I've already built such a good base. So, there's always something different going on in your journey. Just grab the basics, top of the knowledge that I'm giving you right now. Start with this, track it, pay attention to how your body responds, and then adapt accordingly because it's that's the only thing that's going to make you successful, understanding your body and being able to [Music] adapt. All right, so next question. And we're in my personal supplement shop here. Best supplements for bulking. Best Supplements for Bulking Number one got to be creatine. If you're trying to put on muscle, creatine is the best muscle ever. It's good for your brain. It's good for energy. It's good for repair. It's good for putting on muscle. It's the most studied sports nutrition supplement ever. If you're not taking it, you're falling behind. There's so many of the supplements that help build muscle, but specific to bulky and trying to work hard. Number one thing I would say is digestion. I have a pretty good array of digestive supplements that you use at different times. One specifically is a glucose supplement, a GDA glucose disposal agent, typically chromium, Burberry, and a few other things in there that help. And this just helps your body actually utilize all the carbs that you're taking. I never took insulin as a bodybuilder. Some people dabble in that. And it's such a anabolic hormone because it allows your body to use more food and shuttle it into your muscle. So, there's more natural supplements to take. Like I said, Hani makes one called Evalog that has digestive enzymes and a bunch of GDAS in it. Revive has one called glucose. That's a stronger version of just the GDAS. Super helpful. You just take them with every single meal. Super easy to take. Other than that, like I said, the digestive enzymes as well as betain HCL. This bad boy right here. A lot of people don't have the proper stomach acidity for them to digest food, especially a lot of protein. When you're bulking like a bodybuilder, you're eating a lot of protein. So taking a supplement that helps like aid your gut essentially so it doesn't have to work so hard itself is super beneficial cuz the average person should not and does not need to be eating 5,000 plus calories a day. So you want to give your body as much assistance as possible to make sure like I said you're absorbing those nutrients you're actually using them and you're able to pass that food through you so you don't get bloated. You can't eat your next meal and then you just start falling behind. So digestion is absolutely key creatine and anything that helps you uptake carbs. Other than that, of course, post-workout shake, protein powder. It's like the most basic supplement in the world, but \nit's so helpful. Do you need it?\nAbsolutely not. Can you get away without it? You're damn good if you can, cuz I always need it both through prep or an off season. And I still really believe that a post post-workout shake is extremely important. I like to get my EAS midwork still and then right after my workout or at least soon getting in like 50 75 g of carbs with 50 g of protein. And I take that all in powder form. It's just super easy to get down. I can eat again an hour later. I know people are like, \"The anabolic window doesn't matter or whatnot.\" Maybe it doesn't. It probably doesn't if you're getting all your food in, but if it makes me 5% better or.1% better, I'm going to do it. I'm a professional bodybuilder. I want to take everything I can. And it's not that hard to drink a protein shake after your workout. And to be able to get that protein in, starts your your anabolism immediately. Your body's not breaking down tissue anymore. You're rebuilding it. Your recovery gets in immediately. your cortisol drops because your body's starting to get into rest and digest phase which actually also helps your recovery and the quicker you get in the quicker you can eat a meal after that and then go to bed earlier to get good sleep. So all super important things to help your gains and some benefits of supplements. All right, so gym Training While on a Bulk questions. People are always asking how to train in a cut versus a bulk and all these things. And at the end of the day, it doesn't really matter that much if you're training really hard and progressively overloading on proper periodization. You're following my app and you're doing all the stuff you already know. But at the end of the day, it doesn't matter that much. But if you take a look at what's going on when you're on a bulk, if you have a little bit more fluid in your body, therefore in your joints, you have more energy. You're recovering a little bit faster, a little bit easier, there's more nutrients to uptake. And a lot of people think lift really heavy in this phase and yes you should lift really heavy but the thing you can actually get away with more so is doing more volume more intensify just a higher level of hypertrophy. So training in a bulk with a lot of food even on refeed days or whatever you want to up your volume and intensifiers on those days. So things like double, triple sets, drop sets, rest pauses, all those kind of things are what you want to do in a bulk because your body can actually handle that much stimulus and recover from it and you have enough nutrients in your body to push that much volume for a longer workout. It's kind of a different thinking than you might think when you're eating more. You want to do more weight, but you actually want to just still be heavy as possible, but more volume, more intensifiers, and it'll get more gains to use all that food. Like I Chris's Training Cycle said, there's no like optimal perfect way to do it, but that's the way I would do it. And to give an example of the way that my year used to look like with training is I would take some time off, which I would be in right now post Olympia if I were competing again. Give my body a break to kind of recover, get back into it, and then I would start rebuilding my strength for a little bit as food still low, not too high. And as my food ramped up, I would try and have my strengths already back by then. And then I would start doing a crazy amount of volume with that base of strengths. They'll get a little bit stronger at the beginning of your offseason. Then my food gets really high. Use that strength, keeping the weights the same. But then you start adding rest pauses, drop sets, super sets, all the kind of crazy [beep] of just like killing the muscle, pushing some more sets past failure, training with the training partner, all those things that would stress your nervous system a little bit more, but are easier to recover when you have more food in you. So that's the way I would get do it. And right at the end of my offseason when I'd be like peak volume, peak hypertrophy, just like hammering my body. And then when my calorie would start to drop, I would actually start increasing the weight a little bit because my volume would naturally have to come down because I don't have as much energy. glycogen stores in my muscle. Got to drop the volume a little bit, but I keep the weight as high as possible because a stronger muscle is often bigger muscle. So, if you already have the size to your muscle, maintaining strength will maintain the muscle, especially with low calories. So, sometimes it reverses what you think, but it's what I did in the last like pretty much of my whole career and it really helped me get strong,\nmake gains, and hold those gains throughout my prep. All right, next question. \nShould You Do Cardio While Bulking? \nShould you do cardio on a bulk? Like I said, everything is person specific, but if I had to give an overarching answer, it would be yes. for many reasons. Especially as a bodybuilder, the bigger you get, you want to take care of your heart. Obviously, cardio is a way to have the best heart health. So, keeping up with that is super important. But also, not caring about your health. If your goal is just to eat more, cardio helps you eat more. The amount of calories you're going to burn from doing 20 to 30 minutes of cardio, it's nowhere near what you can eat. You can have a bite of a sandwich and overcome the amount of calories you do in 20 minutes of cardio. So, it's really nothing to be afraid of. A lot of people like, I'm trying to huge. I don't want to do cardio cuz I don't want to sacrifice gains. That's complete [beep] Unless you're running marathons or biking two hours fasted or doing anything, you're not going to be losing any muscle. There's a few tips that you can do. Like if you are doing fast cardio because you love doing in the morning, I would 100% recommend taking an amino before that just so you're not burning through muscle. Your body at least kicks some proteins into the fish. At least get three grams of lucine, two scoops of EAS or something and you're good to go. Also, one of the easiest things to do, and this is the Stan efforting thing he used to always talk about on his diet, is doing a 105 minute walk after every single meal that you eat. You're not going to burn through the food that you ate. I promise you, you're not even going to be close to it. But what it is going to do, get your digestion going, lower your blood sugar, help your insulin a little bit, allow your body to actually utilize those nutrients that you put in your body, and then eat quicker in your next meal. Like sometimes you eat a lot and you just want to lie there and you feel like crap, like after Thanksgiving, you just want to pass out. But if you actually go for a walk, your body will start moving that food through you quicker and then you can eat again quicker. It's going to help your insulin levels, which will help your body uptake the food better. So there's a lot of benefits that come into it. So cardio good for your heart. It's actually going to help you eat more and it just helps move the food through you. So I 100% recommend cardio on a bulk. I wasn't always the best at keeping up with this if I'm being completely honest. But I did noticed to a te in the years where I didn't do cardio, but I ate as much as I could. My appetite wasn't as good and I put on fat quicker. Not muscle, but fat. When I was doing a good amount of cardio, I could eat more. I felt better. My body was utilizing it for muscle better than it was at adding fat. So, I just noticed a different body composition when my body was doing when I was choosing to do cardio in my season. So, in the end, when I was doing it all the time, I felt way better. And I absolutely recommend it to everyone. Whether you're skinny, fat, whatever. If you're skinny as [beep] do less cardio. If you're fat, do more. Don't overthink it, but focus on your [Music] heart. All right. So, another question I \nHow Fast Should You Gain Weight? \nalways get asked is around how fast should you gain weight? How do you know \nif you're gaining too fast or too slow? \nAnd again, everything is so person dependent. It's so hard for me to even answer these, but I'm trying to give you guys something to go off of. So, take what I say and apply it to yourself in real life and adapt it. But I would say in the range of 2 to 2 lb a week is like good. It's great for gaining muscle. Again, that could be from a beginner to someone who's advanced. So, when I was young and I was like 18 years old training, I could probably put 2 lbs of muscle on if I really bulked and\ntrained hard and went efficient. And it life, it was incredible. It was amazing. And now over the last 4 years, I've maybe put on 4 lbs of muscle doing what I've been doing. And I've been struggling to do that. And that's me guessing cuz I'm always a little bit leaner and not as lean. So it's like my stage weight is variable. But it's really hard. So it really comes down to a lot of different things. But I think what's super important is having a high standard of which you hold yourself to. So your norm of how you look, you should be proud of how you look. You're working out to feel good, to look good, to be good. So you want to be happy with how you look. So if you start from a leaner spot and you bulk and you don't want to change too much from that, you're not going to be too fat obviously versus if you start from a fatter spot, you get a little more fat, you're more fat than that. So having that norm, that high standard to which you hold yourself to that you're proud of how you look is super important when it comes to these things. It's hard to manage tracking body fat with clips or BMIs or all these things. So, if you're taking constant check-in pictures of yourself, put your weight beside it, the amount of food you're eating with that, and you're following along those things, and you're seeing how your body's adapting, you're much better off than just like guessing what's going on. And obviously, gaining weight, there's so many variables that could be when you first start bulking. You know, your glycogen stores are filling up. You're holding on to more water. Carbs make you hold on more water. Creatine sometimes can, but then it typically levels out. So, don't stress about that. I don't want to say that. But there's so many different things that can make you hold on to weight that aren't just fat or muscle. Water, fat, or muscle are the main top three that it's going to be. So, you really need to be careful of what the difference is. If you diet, if you bulk for a year and you put on 20 lbs and then you diet down and you lose 19. For the average person, that's not a very good bulk. If you're like an elite bodybuilder, then you're doing all right. For the average person, you probably didn't need to put that 20 lbs on to gain one lb of muscle. So, try and like just even that ratio up. Again, I hate giving numbers, but if you're putting on 10% in a year, you're doing pretty good for yourself, depending on the level at which you're at. Just keep watching yourself. Don't let yourself get too fat. Be happy with how you look. Monitor your breathing, your heart rate, all these different things are super important. How you feel, how you look, end up going to the final result. So, \nHow Long Should I Bulk For? \nit's all important. All right. Next \nthing is, how long should I build core? \nMinimum time to put on muscle. If you put on muscle, you put on muscle. But there is a the longer period of time you're holding it, the less likely you are to lose it when you cut really hard. That's something to take into account. If you bulk for 2 months and then you cut really hard, you're probably going to lose a good amount of that muscle versus if you're someone who's been holding on to that muscle for a year, 2 years, 3 years, or 6 months versus a 2-month bulk, you're more likely to hold on to it. So, just take that into consideration. I personally liked a longer bulk because I didn't feel like I had to force it as hard and have to put a bunch of food in really fast. I could slowly taper up 250, 300, 400 calories at a time as my body would plateau. I would just add a little bit more food, add a little bit more food, and my body wouldn't put on fat as quick. The slower the change you make, the more likely you are to put on good weight rather than just fat. So, understand that. Take your time. The longer you hold it, the longer your body's going to maintain it. Also, \nGoal Setting\nagain, super important to be specific on what your goals are and definitely not goal hop around. If you're like, \"Oh, I want to bulk.\" And you bulk a little bit and your abs are a little less shredded. I want to cut. and you start cutting a bit and like I want to be bigger and you start flip-flopping back and forth, you're going to make zero progress and there's no point doing that. So start something and commit to it and understand what your goals are. If your goals are to put on muscle, but you hate when you lose your abs and do a really slow, long bulk, very slow increase of calories. Make sure your abs are staying there. Stick to training your abs. Stick to doing your cardio, eating good food, no inflammation, you won't hold on as much water, you won't look as chubby, won't feel better. All these different things. If all you want to do is put on as much muscle as fast as possible, you don't give a [beep] That's the type of person who pushes it a little bit faster or a little bit longer. So, you kind of got to figure out what your goals are and tailor your work towards your goal. All right, last question and another big one, crucial one. I've been here. What \nWhat if I Can't Increase my Appetite? \nif I can't eat enough and how to increase my appetite? Can't is a very strong word. Whenever I meet someone and they come up to me often at expos, they're like 170 lbs. Like, I can't put on muscle. I can't eat enough. I'm like, you're lying. eat more, train harder, and just do it. There's it's always a possibility. If you really can't put food down and you're skinny skinny, there's probably a reason why your cortisol is too high. Your recovery isn't good enough. You need to sleep better. You need to slow down. You need to eat better foods. You need to check your gut. There's there's a reason why people aren't just that word hardgain gainer. People are harder than gaining than others, but there's no hard gainer who can't eat and gain weight. It's complete [beep] You just have to do it and it takes a long period of time. So the biggest thing is I think honestly is like I mentioned the cortisol sleep recovery. If all that stuff is on point, your body can take in food. There's people you hear about stress eating and people who there's no term for it, but people when they get stressed who just they forget to eat all day. A week go by and they eat one meal a day maybe just because they're so stressed out all the time. When your body's in a fight orflight state, cortisol is running through your body. It's not ready to rest and digest. It's why people say rest and digest. You're in a fight fight or flight cortisol. your body's not ready to digest food. It's not ready to take in food. So, it's super important to eat in a calm state to like be in a relaxed state as often as possible to get your sleep in. Sleep and rest and low cortisol is like the secret to bodybuilding. Me, my ability to like lower my stress at times when I was in prep literally won me Olympias. It's so crucial and it comes in so importantly into bulking as well. So, yeah, that would I would say that's the biggest thing, especially post-workout when you're training, you're at a high level of stress, which is important. you're putting your body through a stimulus and the quicker you can switch your body from fight and flight into rest and digest the better you're doing. So after a workout, if you can like meditate, chill, get your protein in, listen some vibing music on the way home. Don't just get on your phone, go back to work, stress yourself out with some stuff, just like calm your nervous system, you'll be recovering better and you'll be able to eat and absorb more nutrients after that workout. Super important. On top of that, just a little tip trick that everyone knows to do, smoothies. \nPRO TIP \nYou're eating your meals throughout the day. Understand your meals that you can get. Nutrient timing is so important. Pairing that with smoothies, it's the secret. If you figure out your body's nutrient timing of when it can absorb certain foods, certain meals in the best way, you're going to crush it. Me, I like having low carbs in the morning cuz then my entire appetite for the rest of the\nday is bigger. A lot of times I used to think, oh, I need a 1500 calorie breakfast to get these calories in so I don't need as much later in the day. But then I can't eat my meals later in the day and I screw myself. But if you have a high highfat low carb breakfast, your insulin levels are actually more consistent throughout the day rather than spiking and dropping and peaks and valleys throughout the day. So, it's a lot healthier for your body and easier to eat your meals later on the day. So, highfat, whole food, high protein breakfast. Start getting your carbs in around your workout. Bulk of your carbs would be pre and post-workout. I could handle them pre and didn't make me tired, so I was completely fine. And some points in the day, have a massive smoothie. I liked having mine later in the day if it didn't fill my stomach up too much before sleeping. You throw in some intraworkout carbs, some protein powder, some whole eggs for some real nutrients, some oats if you want, some peanut butter, almond butter, whatever you want to throw in there. Whatever your body digests, great. Blend it all up. Drink it before bed. You can get in easily 1,200 calories in a shake. And you don't need to get mass and stuff like that cuz it'll just [beep] your stomach up. Unless you can handle it, good for you. But I never could. So, digest or smooth jeez, blend, load your [beep] up, drink a smoothie, digest it good, go to sleep, and get huge. So, another big thing on that, increase your appetite, low cortisol, nutrient timing, big smoothies, take three. All right, so that's the bulk of these questions. I'm sure I rambled on a heavy amount. If you guys have any more question, drop them in the comment section below. I will add them to the next Q&A; that we do. But yeah, these are the biggest tips and tricks I can say that I've done. I've gone through many different phases of my career bulking really hard and not bulking really hard and again I listened to so much knowledge over my career. I took in so much stuff and I tried so many things. The only thing that stuck were what worked for me. You have to like flow with things. You have to like treat bodybuilding like the art it is and understand that there's so many nuances to it that it's dependent on each specific person and only you can figure out that out for yourself because only you know yourself. So trial and error, pay attention, track things. What is it measured? isn't managed. Lock it all in and get [beep] huge. So that's it. Thank you guys for watching."

    "text": "Cutting ? Video Transcript \nSource: User-provided transcript \nPrepared on 2025-10-26 \nNotes \nThis is a cleaned, formatted transcript based on your text. Short, title-like lines were treated as section headers (e.g., ?How Do I Start a Cut??).\nIntro \n[Music] What is up, YouTube? I was going to do a full day of eating today, which will come soon, but I remembered when I did that ultimate guide to bulking, a lot of people requested the ultimate guide to cutting. So, I'm going to be doing that instead. Still making a meal right now, eating clean, but I'm going to be running you guys through just some tips and tricks that I learned on the long along the way of my bodybuilding career on how to get shredded. It's also because I'm kind of going into like a mini cut of myself, at least trying to lean up while maintain muscle, not a hard tread. But I'll be talking about what I do, but mainly about a lot of questions that I get about it. Similar \nHow Do I Know When to Cut? \nto the bulking one, it started off with how do I know when to cut and how long do I cut for? And again, it's very dependent on what your goals are. But in my opinion, when you start to lose your abs, for me especially, cuz my abs are something that are gone pretty late. So when I have a lot of body fat, I'll lose them. But if you have no ab showing anymore, you might be at the point of a bulk where you're starting to lose and plateau and you need to cut down, you know, fix your insulin sensitivity, your metabolism, your digestion, a lot of things that are better off in a cut. So, when you get to that point where you don't really like how your body looks, you're kind of fatter than you want to be, or you just want to be leaner cuz it's personal preference, then you can start a cut. And cuts can really go as long as you want, depending on how you do it. If it's like a really punch in the face shred and you're like 2% body fat, that's aggressive. sub 10% body fat over an extended period of time, it will start to affect your hormones. So, you don't really want to do that for longer than like, you know, probably 3 to four months. But if you're just like getting shredded, coming back up a little bit, having reheats, consistently fueling your body, and you're continuously making progress in the gym, you can keep going constantly. As long as your body feels good, your body's optimized, energy is good, still making progress, you can keep pushing and going, going. So, don't stress about going too long, unless you're like sacrificing in the gym and you're starting to lose all your gains. \nHow Do I Start a Cut? \nAll right, so the next big thing is how do you start a cut? And in my opinion, there's a lot of ways to do it, but there's two main ways to do it, and it depends on your lifestyle, so I'll go over both. The best way to do it, in my opinion, is you're already eating relatively consistently. Even if you're not tracking, but you think you eat the same thing every day. Log every single thing that you eat for at least a week. 2 weeks is even better. But if you log everything you put in your mouth like condiments, juices, drinks on top of all your food, vegetables, everything, count the calories every single day and track your weight and night and do that for an extended period of time. Most people naturally get to a baseline where they're eating about the same and they're staying about the same weight when they're not trying. And that's your baseline calories. So from there, you need to adjust up or down on where to start. The other way is if you're super inconsistent, you have no idea what you're eating. Sometimes you're up, sometimes you're down, and you don't know where you're going. You can start with a macro calculator. Enter in all your all your information. It will tell you where to start. Give you a rough estimate. But still start with that. Follow it every single day for a couple weeks and track consistently and see what your weight does. If you're gaining too fast or losing too fast or whatever it may be, then you really want to adjust that from the point of picking\nBalancing Macros \nout your macros. Cuz this is personally how I like to diet. I would pick macros and then create a diet plan off that and then stick to that strict diet plan. Macros are super basic. Everyone know this. It's going to be 1 to 1.5 grams per pound of lean body mass of protein that you want to hit. So if I'm 260 pounds in my offseason, but my lean body mass is 240, then I want to be a minimum of 240 g of protein. But I almost always pump that up to like 350 because there's a lot of studies that have shown that if you're hitting up to 100 grams of protein per meal multiple times in a day, you can still use that and increase protein density more and more and more and keep making more gains. And especially in a cut when you're trying to preserve muscle as much as possible, having enough protein is extremely crucial. Even your body's ability to metabolize protein requires more energy and it's less likely to turn protein into fat than it is carbs into fat. Some more protein is a great thing on a cut. Don't be scared of it. Start with that. And then from there, picking your carbs and fats. It's dependent on the individual. I like to do 7030 splits to start. So, I do 70% carbs, 30% fat. And because I have a higher ratio of carbs, as I'm dieting, I'm kind of pulling from that. But it's super simple. You start with that. You find what your baseline is by tracking over an extended period of time. Log your food, log your weight, see what you're at. Biggest tip. Um, I could probably leave 90% of the world. Yeah, they're probably not 90% of the world cuz if you're watching my YouTube channel, you probably care about your fitness. You're more into it. But the average person can just track their weight, write down what they're putting. And that psychological conscious awareness of what they're eating would change their habits of what they're eating. They're like, \"Holy [beep] I'm eating 100 g of sugar from this coke and this [beep] and all that [beep] I'm just I don't want to write that down. I'm not going to eat it.\" And it will make you better. And even myself at the level that I am, that still makes me better to an extent. But when we want to be elite and make gains, you have to go beyond that. So track everything consistently going forward. And once you have that, you have your baseline calories. So your weight's not changing. You have enough protein so that you can recover, make gains, keep your muscle, and you're at a consistent thing. I like to drop two to 300 calories to start and add in a little bit of cardio, not cardio to the point where you're going crazy or not. And I'll get into cardio a little bit later, but the key thing is just drop 200 calories. Personally, I start purely from carbs. So, I have my baseline 1.5 g per pound of body weight of protein, 70% carbs for the rest of my macros, 30% fat, and then I take 200 calories of carbs, and I pull that out of my diet. And then that's how I start, and I know I'm good to go. [Music] Creating a Diet Plan All right, so next thing is that there's two ways, again, two optimal ways, in my opinion, is more to it of creating a diet. There's if it fits your macros. But if it's fit your macros, whole foods, which I recommend way more than if it fits your macros, shitty food. Get into that, too. And then there's just a meal plan. I personally like having a meal plan cuz it just takes the guesswork out of everything. The more you have to consciously think and you get decision fatigue and you go overinking, you're more likely to make bad decisions because naturally we go to the easy decision and we're constantly over and overthink. We're going to pick the easy thing, which is usually better food, more access or something. So, in my mind, having the same thing I'm eating every single day, it just doesn't even have an option to cheat on my meal to cheat on my meal plan. So, I literally write it out and I print it cuz I'm [beep] old like that. If I had a fridge that had a magnet on it, I would put it right on there. But, I write this out. Meal 1 2 3 4 5 plus a shake. And I write it out and I eat the same thing every single day. And then from there, it's easy to break. And if I want on a day, it's like, okay, my breakfast is two eggs, one scoop of isolate, 40 g of oats. I'm rushing out the door. I know 40 g of oats is 27 g of carbs. I have two pieces of toast that are each 15 grams of carbs. I'll survive that day, you know, but typically trying to hit that. The other style, obviously, if it fits your macros, the idea of that one is that you have, my opinion, it\nmeans you have a lot more time on your hands and you're a person who craves foods really heavily. So, the idea is understanding what's going to work best for you. Whatever plan that you can adhere to most consistently will be the best route. Not necessarily saying a diet plan or macros are the better way to do it, but if you're going to do one more consistently, then it's much better. But when it comes to the macros, like I said, whole foods are so much more important. Again, if I were to talk to the average population, I'd be like, track your food, eat whole foods. Just start with fat and most people will be so much healthier and in much better shape. And it's a lot harder to over consume in healthy foods. Like eating ultrarocessed foods, you're just more likely to condense calories in. And on top of that, there's a bigger cascade effect. I'm not a big believer in the whole calories in calories out being everything because there's a hormonal effect that you have of putting foods in your body. There's higher inflammation, higher cortisol, eating at certain times a day, eating shitty foods. It can affect your sleep when you sleep soft. Again, higher cortisol. Higher cortisol mean it's hard harder for your body to burn fat. So, you're not going to get lean as fast. And it could have all these other effects on top of affecting your energy while you train your ability to recover. And obviously, more muscle you have, the more fat you can burn, the more muscle you want to have, more shredded you look. There's so many effects to it. So, I don't even want to talk about if it fits your macro shitty food. I don't recommend at all. Clean bulks, clean cuts, all the way. Healthy food is the way to go. We're taking care of our bodies. Just eat healthy. But if you have the time to go through every single meal and be like, \"Okay, I'm going to have 50 g of protein, 10 g of fat, 30 g of carbs. I can eat whatever I want in the realm of potato, rice, chicken, salmon, almond butter, all the different arrays of healthy whole foods, then good for you. But I don't have [beep] time for that [beep] So, I eat the same thing every single day, and I know what I got to do. And if dinner is something my family's making, then I can weigh it out and figure it out from there. [Music] \nCheat Meals \nAll right, so on the topic of kind of shitty foods like and if it fits your macros, people love to ask about cheat meals. And in my opinion, it depends on the person. If you're trying to drive results is your biggest goal and that's all you care about, then no, you shouldn't be having cheat meals. A cheat meal of shitty food is strictly for the mental reprieve that you need it. So, if you eat [beep] a burger on Sunday and you can continuously lose weight doing that and mentally you feel better and it drives you through the week excited for that, then fine. We all have our reasons to push forward and continue. But if you're optimally trying to progress, then no, cheat meals are not good. I really never had cheat meals throughout my preps unless I like needed to hammer in like a burger and fries cuz I couldn't get enough calories in. 99% of the time it was a refeed day. out with exactly the same foods I'm eating consistently, but instead of 100 g of rice in a meal, it would be like 300 g of rice and an avocado. So, getting that clean food and doing it and just kind of giving my metabolism a kick in the ass, driving the workout the next day. And \nTraining & Nutrient Timing \nagain, I spoke about this a lot in prep, but those would be typically pushed right before a leg day. So, if I had like a heavy workout chest day, the next day was leg day, I'd have the cheat meal that night to recover from that chest day and then drive those carbs into the leg day the next day. So, I'm getting recovery and performance from the benefit. Super important. So, metabolism \nRamping Your Metabolism\nis obviously a big talk when it comes to dieting. And there's like the idea of ramping up your metabolism and also the idea of it slowing down over time. And there's also a lot of debate of whether or not this is true and what causes it. But from my personal experience, which contradicts some studies, but it's worked for me, so I don't really care. If I can ramp up my metabolism before I'm dieting for eating more meals in a day and more food in a day consistently and utilize that food by training maybe a little bit of cardio in my offseason, then when I started prep eating more calories, I'm in a much better position. I've started preps eating 6,000 calories a day and my diet just like coasts through. And I've started preps at like 3,000 calories a day where I need to almost ramp up a bit and then back down and they're much harder. But I've always noticed that throughout my offseason, I get a little bit lazy and I'll eat three meals a day and I'll start to feel sluggish, harder to eat, all these things. And if I cut those meals into smaller meals and I spread them out throughout the day, I'm eating the same amount of food and also my energy will get better, my digestion will get better. I'll start to get leaner while eating the same amount of food. So, I can up my calories. I'm able to obviously consume more energy. Therefore, I'll recover better, train better, and make more gains. And there's a lot of people, everyone scientifically believes that you can't boost your metabolism by eating more frequent meals and spreading them out. So, I don't know, but for me, it has worked every single time. And I've done it in a vacuum. Not many people have been like, I eat the same thing, taking the same supplements that did not change, the same thing consistently, the same cardio, waking up at the same time, eating the same thing. All I did was divide from five to six meals, and I got a little bit leaner from there. And then I went from six to seven meals at the end of my Olympia prep, and it was super helpful for me. So stuff like intermittent fasting can help because it's easy to just not eat and then cram food at the end of the day. But in my opinion, you're going to blunt your metabolism over time to do that and plateau a lot quicker. So not something I recommend. All right, so another \nHow Fast Should I Lose Weight? \nquestion consistently get is how fast should you lose weight and how do you know if you're losing it too fast? And in my opinion, the big best way to avoid that is not by throwing too many tools in at once. So, like I said at the beginning, by just starting with a little bit of cardio and then taking down \n200 calories from your baseline, you're not just going to plummet from doing something such a small change. But if you're like, I'm going to do an hour cardio. I'm going to cut 1,000 calories. I'm going to start doing X, Y, and Z. I'm going to walk every do all these different things and your body starts dropping too fast, then you're much likely to plateau. So, if you're trying to do a long cut, let your body have the tools over time. Start with small things at a time. But on average, I would say if you're losing more than like three pounds a month, you're close to that point. Through my Olympia preps, I would lose I would start relatively lean, but to get like peeled, I would lose 25 lbs over 14 weeks. So that's less than 2 lbs a week on average. But typically, I'd get down to like 250 lbs and then be like 4 weeks out still and I would lose 10 lbs in the last 4 weeks. So there's a way that you can do it up and down. But another big thing on that is if you start hitting plateaus too early when their standard plus group, this is the biggest thing that I've learned from talking to all these people will be like, \"Hey, I'm plateaued. I can't lose any more weight. I'm 220 lb eating a 1,400 calories doing this.\" And I'm like, \"Wa, that's like a low amount of calories for that weight to not be losing any weight.\" So, your body probably starts it needs to ramp up a little bit. And if you're trying to get lean and that's all you care about, let's say you're prep in a transformation challenge or whatever it may be, in my opinion, the best thing that you can do is start carb cycling. And this is like an elite level of dieting. Cutting your calories is one thing, but being able to carb cycle is super effective. So, if you can start having those refeed days, like I said, a high carb day before a heavy workout.\nYou're kind of boosting your body's metabolism. You're letting it know you're going to be giving it fuel. You're going to be giving it something that it needs so it can like work extra hard on those days. train hard, get the system running, and then the next day when you cut back down to low calories, it will like fall through that cell. And it just gives your body the signal that you're not in starvation mode all the time cuz your body's constantly starving. It's just preserving energy and trying to hold on to the best possible. So that's one of the best ways to do it. The other way would just to be pull off your diet for a little bit, up your calories by like 200. So the reverse of how you started, and start ramping up a little bit rather than down, and let your body get used to properly be properly recovering and all these things. There's so many other factors that come into that that I could ramble on forever, but the biggest one I would say is sleep. If you're high cortisol and your sleep is [beep] and you're trying to diet, it's going to stop you from doing it. So sometimes dieting too hard makes you lose sleep. So you need that little bit of recmp where you're eating a little bit more. Maybe you're taking a little bit off training. You're recovering. Your nervous system is recovering. You're sleeping better. You're dropping your cortisol for an extended period of time. And then you hop back in your diet and you'll continue to progress. So don't stress about it. If you're like, I'm eating 1400 calories and I'm not losing weight. I need to go down 1,000 calories. Maybe your body needs a break. But really, really listen to yourself and you have to be tracking consistently to actually know these things. All right, so meals sometimes suck in \nBest Condiments \ndieting. And the topline answer is it is what it is. You're trying to get shredded. Take it. But for people who are just dieting for life or even myself sometimes being able to just optimize condiments to make food taste a little bit better, the three top condiments that I used throughout my preps were honey mustard, Sriracha, and coconut aminos. Cocon probably had the most sugar. I specifically got the whole foods honey mustard because it was the lowest amount of sugar, lowest amount of calories. And in Sriracha, you have to be careful for some of them. They have sugar in them, but those are super low calorie and good to go. But the goal with condiments is if you start your prep with them, keep them in until you have to cut them out. But if you don't have any condiments in and then you add them in later, you're technically adding more calories. So the goal is like if you start consistently with something and you're adjusting changes with everything every other variable being the same variable being the same, then you're good to go to continue to make progress. But you don't want to add in something like honey mustard when you're 2 weeks out the Olympia cuz you're adding in a significant amount of calories relative to what you're eating to not affect it. But food does some suck sometimes. So finding the right amount of condiments to add stuff can be beneficial. But weigh it at least a couple times because you'll be shocked by how much you do it. People who use almond butter are like, \"Yeah, a teaspoon of it.\" They're putting like four tablespoons on it. Or this says five calories per teaspoon. A teaspoon is like absolutely nothing. I would probably put at least four teaspoons minimum on a meal. So, it's 20 calories. So, just be conscious of that. Don't be dumb. What isn't measured, isn't managed. Continue to track your stuff so you actually know what's going in your body and understand why you are or not getting results. Best Supplements for Cutting All right. So, people love to ask about supplements for especially for cutting, putting on muscle or cutting. Cutting, I feel like people just lean into supplements. I never really was big on taking specific supplements that led to fat loss. But in terms of supplements that can help on a cut, first off, I would start with things that are just important in keeping your systems running, whether it be hormone production, energy production, all the different things. So, something like a multivitamin, especially when you're dieting really hard. Hopefully, you're getting your veggies in and all the stuff, but food also\nsucks nowadays. But when you're limiting your food, maybe you're not getting enough nutrients. So something like a multivitamin is super helpful. Beyond that, satiating the body is super important. Protein is huge. So I always have a protein powder in it. It's probably the leanest, easily, easiest digestible, lowest calorie way to get in any amount of protein. The protein shake. Also, in terms of like diet hacks, if you're ever going out to like dinner with people and you're trying to maybe just get a steak and eat food or not eat at all or going out for a long drive or whatever it may be, if you bring a protein shake with you, chug it right before going to dinner, it like kills cravings, kills your hunger super fast when it's only like 140 calories. So, super beneficial to utilize something like that. Amino acids also something really big just in terms of not losing muscle over extended periods of time. Being able to sip on it between meals and spike protein thin more and more time throughout the day to keep yourself progressing I think is super big. On top of that, I would say keeping inflammation low is always important. Same thing as cortisol management, hormone management, just keeping your systems operating. So something like an omega-3, super simple and easy to add in. And then I would say mental things for myself, especially when I'm down to like really dying. You start to be tired and dragging ass and you start to like not be able to remember a lot of things. stuff like alpha GPC, Cognizen, Tyroin to help that dopamine precursor to just keep your body to keep your mind focused and locked in, be able to know what you're doing, especially before the gym, like pre-workouts that have a good amount of caffeine and neutropics in it so that you can focus and get the job done and not just be like tired and lazy and hanging around. Super important. So, in my opinion, I wasn't a big guy taking any fat burners or anything like if I take this, I'll get shredded without doing anything. It was more so optimizing my systems and curbing my hunger, keeping protein sensitive high. I can still not say that word. It'll never come to me. But that was how I viewed supplements in a cut for myself. So give it a shot. Cardio also a huge \nCardio \nquestion people continuously ask about. Similar to what I was talking about not using tools too early, cardio is all about minimum effective dose. So having as minimal as possible when you're trying to maintain as much muscle as possible. And my cardio has changed now that I'm not competing anymore. and I actually care about my cardiovascular health and I want to be able to hit that so it's adjusted. But when I was in prep and I was just trying to get shredded, it was just incline walk on a treadmill. The lowest stress on my body which are where I was burning calories. I was trying to get my heart rate still to like 120 beats per minute. And then the \ndebate is always do you do it at night? \nDo you do the morning fasted? How do you want to do it? And in truth, it really doesn't matter as long as you're getting it done. The only thing is you don't want to do it before a workout because you don't want to take away your energy and nutrients away from driving into putting on muscle because it's still obviously the most important thing. So, I used to like doing it first thing in the morning and then I would eat a couple meals and train later in the day and that was the best way to implement it into my life. Now that I'm retired and life is different, I train after a meal one. So, I don't do cardio in the morning and I'll typically do cardio post-workout. So instead of doing before, which ruins your workout, I get the workout in. Maybe I'll get some aminos and then I'll do some cardio at my gym or or if I'm not at work all day that day, I'll come home and I bought two pieces of cardio that are a little bit more fun than just walking on a treadmill. So, I have a rower that I've been doing for hit training and then I have a bike which I can bike around my neighborhood and sometimes I combine both of them just to get more interest more interesting and I'll do them later\nin the day, do them in the sunlight, get outside, do some things and it kind of gets more active and gets me outside doing things rather than just chilling. I will also say that there's some people who train bodybuilders who get shredded and win shows who don't do any cardio. They just tell them to increase their steps. Start at like 5k steps, 7k steps, go to 10k steps, and just walk more in a day and track that. And those people get shredded, too, and it's possible. Some people get shredded without cardio. It really just depends on your body. So, the goal is if you're not losing weight and you brought your calories down a little bit, then add a little bit of cardio. I would start with 20 minutes five times a week, and just get your body moving, consistently burning a little bit more calories. The more output you have, the more input you can have, the more you can eat, and it's just a better system for your body to run. So, try different things that work best for you. You can do hit cardio, low intensity, steady state cardio, whatever you want to do. But if you're a bodybuilder, an optimalist muscle training, shredded, nothing else, low intensity, steady state is the way to go. Now that I want to have better heart health, better HRV, be in better shape. I've been doing a little bit more hit cardio at times, more biking, more this, more that, and it's super helpful. All Training on a Cut right, so training on a cut. You could get a lot deeper into this, but I'm giving you guys the [beep] top line right now. most important thing that you need. But in my mind, the goal is to not have to change your training until you have to. A lot of people are like, \"Oh, I'm cutting. I'm going to be tired. Let me drop the weight and then do more volume.\" And they do that before they're actually tired. But you don't want to preemptively do that. You want to wait till you're actually to the point where you can't lift a certain weight cuz you're so exhausted that it has to pull down. But if you can keep pushing forward and keep training hard and training intense through a cut and not changing anything, you're going to be better off. You're going to maintain more muscle or even put on muscle throughout that cut. So, I never really had different programs that were like, \"Hey, I'm going to do sets of 20 now that I'm dieting because it burns more calories.\" Because it really the amount of car calories extra that it burns is like negligent and you're just sacrificing gains by not lifting the way that's optimal to maintain and build muscle. So, don't really do it. How do you train like that? You really just don't be a [beep] The longer that you can actually push yourself and just mentally train hard, you're going to be better off for it. So, the thing that you can do in a cut around training that helps it is just nutrient timing. When you're down to really low calories and low carbs, the best way training wise is to put your carbs like moderate before, high after. It's not high, but if you have 50 g of carbs in a day, which is super low, I would do 20 g pre, 30 g post, and split it up like that so that you're getting it around your training, which is the most important time of the day for your body to be able to recover and utilize that as you need it. And that's really the biggest thing that I change around cutting other than just spreading out the carbs throughout the day. The only time that would change is if your sleep is really bad and you're starving in the middle of the night and you can't sleep. You can test this everything at the test in a sample to see what works best for your body by putting some carbs right before bed and seeing if that doesn't create a blood sugar drop, a cortisol spike in the middle of the night, which will ruin your sleep and then again will affect your cortisol, your gains, your fat loss, everything else. But beyond that, keep training hard. Don't change your program unless you have to put carbs around the workout. You're good to go. All right. So, I'll just go through a bunch of like tips and tricks now because a big question is like how do I How to Fight Cravings fight cravings? Essentially, again, topline answer is if you want high results, expect high discomfort. That's just the way it was. The more you suffer, the more you endure, the more results that you'll see. So, that's part of life and it's inevitable. But on top of that, if you're like constantly hungry, having hungry, having crazy cravings, one thing it may be is cortisol. High cortisol leads to a craving for ultrarocessed food, sugar, dense calories, whatever it may be, it makes you want food more. So things like screen exposure, being on your phone too much, having a stressful life situation, poor sleep, all these different things first of all affect each\nother, which then also affects the cascade of your hormones that make you more hungry and constantly wanting things. So just be conscious of that. All right. So huge Create a System for Success thing. I talk about this a lot. Having a structure, having system, setting yourself for up for success. A taking the guesswork out of it. So when you have a conscious brain, when you want the goal and you have good drive, you create a plan and then when your brain is feeling weak and falling off, you just follow the plan and it makes it easier for you. But setting yourself up with something like a system going throughout your day. Let's say I tell you it's perfect to eat your carbs before and after a workout, but in your mind, you train right in the middle of the day, and then when you come home at night, you have these crazy cravings. Well, then maybe it's better for you to drive results for you to have lower carb throughout the day while you're at work, driving the kids to school, doing things, busy, not thinking about it. You keep your calories low as possible, carbs low at that point. And then when you're home at night and you're chilling, you're bored, you're hanging out doing nothing, your cravings start to come. Well, at least you have carbs for that. So, it's kind of called carb backloading than putting it at the end of the day. And just that's more playing a mental game than it is a physical game, which is totally fine. If it drives results, it works. These things are all very nuanced and they're like fractional benefits. Eat at the right time and do all the things. When you stack these things, they work out a lot. But if you can't follow it because it's too hard, there's no point. So set yourself up for success. Create a system, a structure, a schedule that you cannot break. Another big thing that \nSeek Accountability \ncould help is having any level of accountability. Top line of this would be having a coach, having someone who's checking in on you, holding you accountable, helping you create structure, and just checking in on you essentially so you know you have accountability somewhere. absolutely huge. Not everyone can afford that. So sometimes having things like a friend who's doing it with \nyou, maybe a partner who supports you, let your wife, girlfriend, whatever know that this is super important to you, be on top of me, track me, work on these things, help me work through this stuff. Beyond that, if you don't have that, if you have friends who lift, hang around the gym. You'll probably find some. But even my app, the standard community, we have the transformation challenge. We have standard plus. We have weekly calls. We have a circle group chat. We have all these chats hanging out in there that people can meet and talk to each other and hang out there as they're working through their goals. And just being around that energy. You are who you surround yourself with. So being around that is super helpful. All right. So a \nPost-Meal Walks \nbig thing that I struggle with cuz I live in Florida, but it I'm when I do it, I feel way better is doing a 10-minute walk after every single meal that you eat. There's two reasons why. a lowers cortisol, helps your digestion, lowers your blood sugar and it's so good for you. They've literally done studies comparing this to metformin and it's had very similar effects. Stan effort efing have been talking about this for like 20 years and they're just doing studies on now proving it. Again, bodybuild is always head of the science. Just saying it. He's also a really smart dude though, so do that. But people who don't want to do cardio, don't want to do all this stuff to be able to just eat and then just go walk around for 10 minutes is not that hard. If you're structuring your day properly, you have time for that and it'll be so much more benefit to your body. And same thing like I was talking about for the cardio. If you don't want to do cardio for an hour or whatever, just getting in more steps in a day is super efficient. So if you're someone who has phone calls in a day or you're listening to a podcast or you just have breaks throughout the day instead of sitting\nthere scrolling your phone or doing nothing or sitting on a couch on the phone or behind your desk on the phone, put your AirPods in, headphones, whatever you got and go walk around the parking lot, walk around the building, whatever it may be, and figure it out. and help you get in much better shape much faster. Talk about this a lot \nDigestive Health \nwhen it comes to a bulk but cutting just as important digest digestion can't say that word either is absolutely huge when it comes to anything optimizing progress for your body when it comes to building muscle or burning fat. So being able to do things like eat food in a conscious state, if you're in a high stress state, eating food, not really chewing, swallowing, like big pieces, that's going to create bad digestion, mess up your gut, not be able to absorb nutrients properly. Again, like I keep talking about, spike your cortisol, hold on fat more, just ruin a lot of things. So having digestive supplements if you need to take a betain HCL before you eat, some gut health products, something that's going to help you digest, digest enzymes, whatever it may be. But even just being off your phone, chewing your food more, being intentional with it, doing those 10 minutes walks after every single meal can help you so much in progressing and moving forward. And just these little tips and things that you can add throughout the day. And the more touch points that you have in the day that are progressing you towards your goal, the more conscious you are of your goal and the more likely you're going to continue to make good decisions. to doing that on top of creating a plan while you're at the beginning of the day or have the beginning of the weekend full of energy and follow that plan when you're tired throughout. You're setting yourself up for success and you're in a much better position than most people. So, at the end of the day, cutting sucks. It can be hard. It can be also be easy when you get to a certain point, but if you want to get shredded, it's not always fun. But if you want to get something, got to go through hard [beep] sometimes. It's just the way it is. If you want to drive results that most people don't get, you have to do things that most people won't do, and it's the way it is. So, all these tips and tricks are something that help and there's so much more I could talk about and even myself now being on a diet and progressing forward in all the YouTube videos to come, I'll keep implementing little tips and tricks and showing you how I'm doing it and adapting what I'm trying, what's worked for me, what doesn't. So, I'll continue to talk about this cuz there's so much more that you can do. But at the end of the day, like I said, create a plan, stick to it, check your food, eat healthy food, and take care of your body because being healthy is what matters. So, have a good reason to do what you're doing, and it will work out better in the end. Yeah, that's my ramble on cutting for the day. So, I hope you guys enjoyed this. If you guys want to see me ramble on other random topics, plan in life, let me know. Like I said, I will continuously be talking about this stuff going forward. So, thank you guys for watching. I'll see you later. \nHere's the second video's transcript on cutting"

Short, slogan-like lines were treated as headings where appropriate.\nWhat is up, YouTube? Just stopped by the warehouse because we got a new flavor. Couple new flavors coming out of stuff. Watermelon grape pump. Absolutely fire. We do not have enough pump flavors and I've been pushing for these. So, I'm very excited to finally get this and training upper body today. So, I'm fired up about that. Quick update on my training. Right now I'm in I don't know what phase 572 or some [beep] of this rehab, but we're coming out on the other end and I have a phase of hypertrophy coming up in the next week. So today's a pretty predominantly hypertrophy day. Got some stained in the background. Spotify has been finding my jams from the AI system. But um yeah, my next phase of programming is a lot more hypertrophy based, which I am fired up about. I have like a chest and back day and then an arm and shoulder day and then a quad day and a hamstring day. Two on, one off. Upper, lower, rest, upper, lower. So, I'm fired up about that. I feel like I've been lacking a lot of drive in the gym. And I texted Justin about this and I'm like, \"Yo, is my training going to be like this forever?\" Because I'm like ready to lose my [beep] cuz I'm going in the gym and doing like isometric hold split lunges and glute bridges and [beep] rotator cuffs for sets of 30 times six sets. And I was just sick of it to be completely honest, you know. And I was listening to this thing talking about like the only way you see progress in life is through discomfort. And I'm so used to the discomfort being Sorry, that was annoying. The discomfort being training hard and intensity and like pushing through hard training and hard dieting and all these things. And the discomfort that I've been experiencing was just doing the boring little easy [beep] that I did not want to do. And it was for me discomfort because I was [beep] bored and didn't want to do it. But it was what I needed for the progress. My body needed to heal my shoulder. But I'm kind of over that [beep] So, I'm ready to train [beep] hard again and get jack and put some muscle back on because I've gotten to be way too much of a skinny [beep] I'm actually not that skinny yet, but it's coming there. I actually busted a tank top today. It's like 110? here in Florida and I still have no air conditioning in my gym. So, with that being said, I'm going to get the [beep] out of here. I'm gonna drink this on the way to the gym and then I'll see you guys there for a little bit of I mean it's kind of full upper body minus there's no specific delt movement but I'm going to be moving up the weight doing what I do trying to get a nice little pump. All right. So, last week's gym quote was sweat the small stuff because we are beautifully obsessed with doing something. People think it's bad to be obsessed, but we love to be obsessed with the gym. So, we sweat small stuff, every little detail. This week, you're not going to be able to read this at all. My marker died. Now, I can't have a cool whiteboard anymore. Horrible writing, so don't judge me. I don't even know if I know how to spell this. Consistent discomfort equals discomfort. Gross. Holy [beep] I am if dyslexic today. Consistent discomfort equals consistent growth. I don't even know if I still said that right. Pretty much what I'm talking about in the car is what I was thinking about. It's like being in a state of consistent discomfort means that you are consistently growing in some capacity and getting better. And even if you think deeper on that, if you are in a state of consistent discomfort, it means you're consistently changing. Because if you do the same thing consistently, what used to be discomfort then becomes comfort because your body gets used to it. Things that used to be hard now becomes easy or feel easier. So less discomfort means less growth. You have to continuously adapt, continue to evolve and find ways to get better and change and fine-tune your goals and what you're doing and everything like that. So like the discomfort I was having before was just like coming in the gym consistently, not wanting to do the things, but knowing it with what I needed to do to progress. And then it got to a point where I was like, \"Okay, you're kind of losing the progress that you were getting from this. The shoulders good enough now. Now it's time to get in the gym and actually start training hard again and getting into this discomfort of intensity and training hard and pushing things and learning how to do that again with my body.\" And I think the most distinct place that you see this in results is dieting. People who cannot lose weight, who can't get lean, if you're not hungry, if you're\nnot uncomfortable, you're not going to lose weight. It's like switching your perception of that hunger is bad cuz like we're hardwired to think hunger means we need to eat. But to switch it, be like, \"Well, my goal is to get lean or my goal is to lose body fat or lose weight.\" To sit in that discomfort and to actually be like, \"I'm hungry. It feels uncomfortable.\" That will lead to consistent growth or consistent fat loss. Opposite of growth technically, but growth towards your goal. So, this is the the theme of the week. Step into discomfort. And it's absolutely [beep] applicable to everything in life. What I remember mostly for I really experienced this was in 2022 when I first started working with Hani. I was going through a lot of changes in my life and I still sucked at public speaking and it's something I wanted to get good at. So I just threw myself into consistent discomfort. I put myself into like talks, Q&As;'s. I'd go to events and be like I'll talk in front of a crowd. I agreed to seminars. I did all these things that I did not want to do. And I was so uncomfortable doing all those things. I got anxious before every single time. I was worried. But it made me better and better at it. made me grow in the terms of my skill as a public speaker, but also that confidence led into everywhere else in my life. So being able to seek out discomfort, I think, is so important because if you don't seek it and get the growth that you want, life is going to throw you into discomfort regardless. It's just not going to be by choice, you're going to become a little victim, little [beep] and be complaining about it and not be where you want to be. So, you might as well go find it and build the life you actually want. So, that's my rant for this beautiful Sunday morning. Let's try and get Jack. All right, I might have been a little ahead of myself on being excited for this workout. I checked my program and it's not fully fun yet, but next week part of my program is chest workout of choice, back workout choice. So, I've been kind of like doing specific things to protect my body, but I'm getting that itch to just like be creative in my workout and kind of do something different than just the specific movements that don't harm me. So, I'm close enough now where to my program specifically to lean towards doing what I want to see like every every now and often you got to just scratch an itch that you really want to do, but also kind of experiment in new movements. See what affects my shoulder, what imbalances I have in certain positions, certain movements. My left arm is much weaker than the right arm because it's still recovering or I can't even do the range of motion or whatever it may be. So, this week is still perfect form of stuff I know I can't properly do. Ramping up intensity every week. Next week is fun stuff. All right, so this is the moment where I should have the 5 lb increments in my weights, but I used to be young and reckless and only give a [beep] about jumping 10 to 20 lbs. And now I probably wish I had more, but 70s last week I don't have 75. So going to go for the 80 this week. Probably going to feel a little bit heavy. [beep] it. It's a goal. So that's all I got to say. Wish me luck. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. \nThink \nI actually got 13 instead of 12. I can't count. When I'm trying to do a three, one, one, one tempo. All I know is I'm trying to control the weight down. Slight pause at the bottom of the rep so I'm not getting any momentum out of it. A, protect my shoulder. B, strengthen my shoulder in each part of that lengthen position. Control the weight the whole way. Feel good. Last week 70s felt exactly like that. This is the beauty of having muscle maturity coming off an injury. but I can bounce back real quick. So, if I can keep my form this clean, keep progressing, have some crispy form, these 150 lb dumbbells. It's been a while since I moved those. It's been a long time. Long time coming. All right, back row X, whatever. Star Trek M machine semi pronated grip, semi neutral grip. Doesn't really [beep] matter. I'm just trying to move heavier weight than I did last week essentially. But it is what it is.\n[Applause] \nHeat. Heat. So felt good. Heat. Heat. Yeah. Heat. knock. \n[Applause] \nIt is crazy how much just lifting a little hardy hardy harder boosts my mood compared to just like fine-tuning form and everything like that. It's a necessity. But my life has switched so much since being just a bodybuilder, being a father now being my priority, having the businesses that are growing so fast, pulling me in so many directions. On top of that, the media outlets, the documentary, all the things like I'm a [beep] bodybuilder and I'll have like eight things on my calendar throughout the day and I'm like brain dead after that [beep] Like my mind is not built for that kind of life. I like creativity stuff, creative stuff. I like training hard, doing hard [beep] I don't like the nuances of business nearly so much. I've dabbled in a lot now, so at least I can learn where I like and wherever I enjoy the most, I put the most energy and I reap the most rewards. So, it's an important learning lesson for me. But just having my life switched to having so much stuff keeping my mind busy in ways that I don't fully love and then not having training to like balance it out to get in the gym and just like decompress all that and feel good. It's been like a it's been a not I mean a challenge, I guess. I just haven't felt like myself fully. when I come in the gym and I can like lift hard and I'm I'm still not going crazy intense but like this is a higher intensity than I've lifted in like six months from my injury especially for upper body to be able to just push a little bit of weight like that to be moving up weights seeing like the progressive overload coming just feels good just like you had a shitty day who the [beep] cares you're lifting weights you're stronger than you were last week it's a beautiful day got nothing to complain about it's kind of incredible how great the gym is there's so much of my life that has been evolved from working out like my confidence my anxiety, my mental peace, everything. So much that I've learned from my life and so much that I've like used to get through the hard times that comes from the gym. And I'm just so grateful for that. And that's why I try and kind of share a lot of like mental mindset shift because doing hard stuff is what causes your brain to learn that thing. And the gym is such a beautiful thing where you can consciously choose to do it and pull what you want from it and just have such a positive outlet where you're intentionally putting yourself into doing something hard where you can see results, build confidence, and use that confidence in other areas of your life. Turned into a tangent here, but just feels good to lift some heavy weight again. I almost said heavy ass weight, but I'm not quite there yet. Heavier weight. One of these days I'll be back at the heavy ass weight and we'll be rocking and rolling. Heat. Heat. \n[Music] \nHeat. \n[Music] \nHeat. \n[Music] \nHeat. \n[Music] \nHeat.\n[Music] \nHeat. Heat. \n[Music] \n[Music] \n[Music] \nMan, this one still gets the best of me. This is one where if you guys have not felt your arms hurt in a while, just throw this in there. A little bit extra volume. Cook your arms real quick. Little bit of variable muscle action. Same thing I did last week. Super set here. I have the proper machine I'm supposed to be doing on this time for put back grips. Increase that propriception. Make sure the right muscles are moving. But essentially, I'm doing 10 reps controlled negative controlled contraction 10 times. Pause in the middle for 10 seconds and then go again. Still trying to control the negative, but I'm really just kind of trying to get through 10 reps at this point to be completely honest. So, both things are exactly like that. 10 10 second pause 10. Feel like my biceps are ripping off my arm better than this. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. That's a sign that that was too heavy for this specific exercise. [beep] it. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. It's incredible what a little bit of a pumpkin do. might fade in about 30 seconds, but looks like I put on 20 pounds. Hey Siri, how many weeks until the Olympia? Just kidding. Maybe, maybe not. Open round two for the Olympia. All right, so that's a wrap on today's workout. Getting on to the fun stuff next week. Like I said, more and more hypertrophy, more and more jack, push myself more and more. But I was talking about discomfort because I realized like in the beginning of this year especially and just post retirement I was just like giving myself a lot of giving myself a lot of easy comfort and it made me feel like shitty. It it kind of increased my anxiety. It increased my stress. I was feeling more overwhelmed by little things in my life that I don't have control over because there's obviously the [beep] that comes in your life that you can't control but then there's so much that you can control and I wasn't actively in control of those things. So then the other side of my uncontrollable things was causing a lot more stress in me and it was stupid little things. It was like not waking up when I told myself I was going to wake up but wasn't doing cardio when I was going to do cardio. I couldn't train hard because of my injury and then I I wasn't dieting anymore. I didn't have this Olympic goal so I wasn't really eating on track. If I went to the pantry and there was a cookie I wanted there and I just eaten an hour ago. I'm like [beep] it. I'm going to eat the cookie. And I did that for a while and it just like made me feel worse about myself. It was so strange to have more freedom. Made me feel more like [beep] trapped and anxious. And I think it's a very common theme amongst a lot of people right now. I think we're at an unfair advantage if I want to empathize with myself in the world of how powerful like our evolutionary brains are to seek out comfort and entertainment and food and abundance. And we have so much [beep] coming at us right now. Like it's so easy just to go on your phone. You're bored for 2 seconds. Pull your phone up. No one experiences boredom anymore. You're a little bit hungry or at least you think you're hungry but you're probably just bored. go in the pantry, grab a [beep] bag of chips, and no one experiences hunger anymore. And that's why I thought like part of the reason why I love bodybuilding so much because it forced you into these things of like starvation for three months essentially. Not starvation, that's very dramatic, but you're extremely hungry for 3 months. You're absolutely focused in a gym pushing yourself past limits that you want to do. You're sore all the time. You're hurting. You're aching. And you still have to go in and do a level of work regardless of how you feel. I think pushing through that discomfort led to so much more confidence and\nfulfillment and happiness within myself and ease of anxiety cuz I'm definitely an anxious person who overthinks a lot. And the more I wasn't in control of those things, the more the anxiety started to creep into my life and I wasn't sleeping. I was getting up through the night overthinking and all this stuff. And just being able to take control of the little things like what I put in my mouth, how I'm training in the gym, when I'm waking up, little things with my health and all that stuff makes everything feel so much better. And I think if you don't put yourself into positions of discomfort, you're not going to grow to be able to handle that. And throughout my career, you know, I would put in a lot of positions where I should have like stopped or I should have taken a break or injuries or health issues or personal things going on where it would have made complete sense and everyone would have validated me if I had backed out. But because the goal was so important to me, I pushed through. And what that led wasn't just six Olympias. to finish my career as someone who can handle hard [beep] where you feel less anxious if you believe you're somebody who can handle hard things when it comes your way. And the only way you can become that someone is by going through hard things. So if you live an extremely easy life, you're doing the same habits every day, eating shitty, kind of training, not really hard, going to work at the same time, doing the same [beep] not pushing yourself to get a promotion or anything, you're just going to feel like blah. And then if [beep] life punches you in the face with some crazy [beep] you will not be prepared for it. So, I think inevitably life will present you with some extreme discomfort at one point or another. And if you haven't consciously chosen to put yourself into discomfort prior to that, you will be a lot less mentally prepared for it. There's nothing you can truly prepare for anything in life, but you can make yourself more of a resilient, level-headed, calm person in the face of adversity. And I think that's so powerful. And I don't think people realize the day-to-day ease of anxiety that leads to. You know, I meet so many people who are so stressed and anxious and don't know what to do. And it's like, just go do some hard [beep] Push yourself through some levels of discomfort. Like for me with public speaking, it's been training hard. It's been dieting. It's been fasting for 3 days or whatever it might be. Whatever things I feel like I don't want to do. I'm not a morning person. So, I've been waking up really early every day and I just [beep] hate it in the morning. But like an hour later when I'm awake, I'm like, I'm glad I did that. Tiny things doesn't have to be hard. And you work your way up to big things. like a big goal like the Olympia allows for big challenges to come in my way and a big opportunity for growth. So, I think that's just so important and it's had me actively thinking about like random hardship I could do and that's why I did that 80 hour fast cuz I was like I feel like I'm every time I'm hungry I'm eating. Can I not do that for 3 days and I did it and I felt good after. Just little challenges like that, you know? Maybe one of these days I'm going to go [beep] drop myself in the woods out of a helicopter in Alaska and go hunt some grizzly bears or something. That would be the dream. But like I said, work your way up to some crazy challenges like that. But I don't know. Maybe this is my brain going crazy cuz I'm retired and I'm seeking for something. But I don't really give a [beep] It It feels exciting. Something I want to do. I'm enjoying training hard right now and that's enough for the moment. But I just like to seek some things that lead to discomfort. You know, even the public speaking thing I haven't done in a long time and now I get anxious when I think of doing it again. So I'm like, \"All right, [beep] I should probably put myself into that position again because it's something that I'm resisting that I feel fearful of doing.\" And I really think so much confidence comes from that. And again, this is why I [beep] love the gym so much. And I want to promote [beep] everyone getting in the gym. If I had a piece of advice for any young person of what to do with their life, I'd be like, \"Go start working out. Apply the discipline to the gym. Every time you don't want to go, go. When you're tired, go. When you're sore, work harder. Like, keep pushing through those times. Be consistent.\" And the confidence you build from consistency and doing things you want to do will just apply to everything else in your life. And I think it's so crucial. I'm a huge believer in that. But with all that being said, this\nworkout is done. I'm going to go get some food. Courtney's making waffles today, so I'm going to go bucking in on that. And that's it. Thank you guys for watching."

    "text": "How to Build the Life You Want ? Transcript (Chris Bumstead) \nCompiled on October 28, 2025 \nI hope I'm not the only one who goes through phases where I absolutely suck at like hitting goals and being consistent essentially I realized that competing in the Olympia and being a bodybuilder I was going through so many phases where I would get super ramped up and prep be super consistent on a tight schedule a tight routine everything at the same time every day doing everything I needed and then I would kind of dip down right after the I would kind of fall off I'd go to the gym when I find the time but I didn't really have a routine so I would often skip days not feel great and I was giving myself a break and when I did that a lot of other things in my life were kind of falling off and then it would slowly ramp up in my offseason you know travel and business and work is kind of crazy and then it would get super dialed and locked in again for prep and I was just realizing that I was going through these phases and I was so efficient in prep and then very inefficient other times of the year so I wanted to take some of the habits and the mindsets and the things that I applied throughout prep that made me efficient and learn how to apply them to like my day-to-day life forever consistently so I kind of dove in for the last week or so just like reflecting and writing down some things that I did and my goal is to apply them to my life going forward forever and hopefully help you guys too so I'm not going to get into too deeply because I'll be sitting here for an hour and I wrote a [ __ ] lot of [ __ ] but I'm going to just tell you guys some things I put down and maybe it'll help you first thing is a clear goal obviously at the Olympia you know there's nothing more clear than a [ __ ] goal October 14th 2024 competing at the Olympia in Las Vegas like that's the goal I got to win the Olympia but this thing that always stuck with me super cheesy and I'm not going to get into deep cuz my mom was the one who taught it to me and you can find it online but it's called smart goals it stands for specific measurable achievable relatable and time base so specific you need a very specific goal not just like I want to be strong it's like how strong do you want to be at what date do you want to be strong what lifs do you want to be explosive strong do you want to be like powerlifter strong what are your specific goals measure obviously be able to measure it attainable has to be possible relatable has to be authentic to yourself something you care about time base there has to be a time base on it like I said I'm not going to get deep into that because you guys can Google that yourself but the big thing that I wanted to touch on here that I realized I applied into becoming Mr Olympian I think really helped me drive my success in my life was instead of having a goal necessarily like a thing that would end and then like the Olympia would fall off afterwards it was more of an identity a sense of self that I was trying to build and become someone who could complete X so the way I kind of worded it and I had written this down in one of the monologues they did before a prep Series without even realizing that was the way I think it's instead of I want to win the Olympia it's the goals you could write out to be more efficient I want to be someone who X so I want to be someone who trains consistently every single day hit sets to failure never Skips a meal never cheats on his diet gets his sleep and Recovery that he needs all the these different things like that and I thought that was so important and a huge thing for me within that was it wasn't just the actions and the physical things you did but your mentality the way you think\nthe way you treat people and all these things cuz you might think of the identity of the champion as someone who is a little bit you know edges on the side of arrogance super cocky confident and that's what winners do because a lot of people we see in the media are like that but that wasn't relatable or authentic to me so the self I wanted to betray before I was the champion was the humble respect full champion who treated everybody the same whether it was a former Mr Olympia backstage a stage Marshal a security guard whoever it might be the person the champion I wanted to be with someone who embodied that respect because I knew people would be looking up to me when I became this Champion not only for what I did but who I was and I wanted to be someone that my mom and their moms would be proud of if that's how they were acting so the next thing I kind of dove into here was you have an identity and then creating a list of things and defining very specifically what those people do and this comes back to that goal is I want to be someone who X so I want to be someone who you know what does Mr Olympia do and I you write that list down and you know you treat people with respect you're humble you go to the gym every single day whether it's to train or to do active recovering to stretch to hit ABS to hit your accessory body parts you know you never cheat on your diet and doing these things as much as possible the more you define these habits and you live these habits you will naturally become the success that you want to achieve so instead of chasing after that goal you become the identity and the person that will naturally attract that goal I think the biggest thing that people always come to me and ask me when I'm doing like meet and greets and they ask me it's always like how do I start what do I do how do I start I have all these things XY andz and you can watch a million YouTube videos read a million books and sometimes you get like overwhelmed by the amount of steps that are out there and and I mean nothing matters unless you actually do it so taking action is the most important hardest part you know I've always had this mindset that you are not what you think you're not who you think you are you just simply are what you repeatedly do so you can think positive things you can think this is huge in relationships you know like I could tell my my wife I think you're beautiful I think I love you I just don't say it well she's not going to know and feel it unless I show her with my actions and it's the same at anything in life so taking action is the most crucial point of everything and I think what people [ __ ] up is they get over overwhelmed with too many steps and things to do so this is going to be the most basic tip but the most important one if you take anything away from this build an identity and start [ __ ] small to build momentum those three things are everything when you break that down so for example when I used to be in college I used to drink three times a week get like blackout drunk go out with my friends and I loved it you know I love the social life I was in college hanging out with people was the only time my life had to be able to live like that and I was aware of that so I didn't want to sacrifice that so I did that for a period of time but then I wanted to take bodybuilding more seriously I was on the edge of going pro and I knew I had a lot of potential in me but I knew my lifestyle was holding me back but I also wasn't ready to sacrifice my social life yet so instead of just telling myself all right I'm going to stop drinking stop going out go to bed at 9:00 p.m. wake up at 6:00 a.m. do my cardio never miss a meal do all these things I was like I'm eating pretty good still cheating a lot cuz I like going out my friends and I love going out at night but I'm going to stop drinking so I still stayed out until 2 a.m. every night but I made one small change and that would to stop drinking and just that alone waking up not hung over and not wanting to eat bacon and [ __ ] God knows what else for breakfast CU you're hung over and tired and lazy having a bad workout horrible recovery from the alcohol throwing up your system I was able to make a decent amount of progress from that alone and the momentum I built from that one small change encouraged me to want to make more changes and eventually I stopped going out completely started\nto go to bed early I started to clean up my diet and I started to make all these little changes that eventually that literal year was the year that I turned Pro won two pro shows and made it to the Olympia just from making these subtle changes and it was huge and the one change I made made this Cascade effect into everything in my life and I think starting small in order to build momentum and being conscious that you were starting small intentionally to build momentum is huge so the goal when you're starting something especially if you're fresh the goal is to be consistent not perfect so create an identity Define what that person does start small and make your goal to pick something that you can be consistent with where imp perfect I don't need you achieve the whole list pick one start with that and with that momentum start another one and another one and another one and after a while once you're embodying these habits these actions and these behaviors without even thinking of your goal anymore you're going to achieve your goal as long as you're doing this like well thought out and the idea with momentum is I mean as anything if you're driving a car and you take your foot off the brake and you roll into a wall you're going to just [ __ ] tap into the wall [ __ ] up your car a little bit if you're driving 150 miles per hour at a brick wall and just [ __ ] fly right through that thing probably keep going there through at the other side you might you know get a little scratches on your car but you're still moving it doesn't stop you because you have so much momentum and that's the same thing with this after starting making those small changes when I was young and building these habits over time I didn't even feel like it was like I was dieting I didn't feel like I was eating healthy I didn't feel like I was training hard it was just life it who I was and it was what I did so when something came in the way whether I was in prep and it was my lat tear my hamstring tear 2018 when I was in the hospital you know last year I had a minor hamstring tear I didn't even really talk about it became the thing where I didn't even have a chance to hold me back because I had so much momentum had such an identity attached to behaviors that I did that when something came in to stop me I just kept rolling forward through it after so a lat tear would be something that would hold me back for a little bit and I'd be immediately back on my [ __ ] moving forward getting better and better and I can't stress that enough that momentum is like the secret to get through stuff cuz when things are so habitual that you don't have to think about them that when chaos hits in your life whether it be personal stressful mental emotional physical your habits you don't have to think about they take less energy so you just keep moving forward you keep getting better better and it's [ __ ] everything all right so the next little tip amongst all these all are kind of the actionable steps but the other thing that I realized I did without knowing it is selft talk and like personal accountability I tie these in together because how you talk to yourself is sometimes how you hold yourself accountable but personal accountability means you're responsible for your own life which means you are Empower you have the power to control and change your life so personal accountability equals power power is the ability to do whatever the [ __ ] you want in your life so no one else wants you to [ __ ] hit your goals like you do no one cares what you do Beyond yourself so make sure you're holding yourself accountable you're not waiting for someone else to encourage you you're waiting for someone else to go to the gym do this or that you really have to hold yourself accountable you know it's in the selft talk piece a little thing that I this is how I label it now but I wasn't intentionally doing it in purpose in the time but I was always talk to myself in my head like I was a mentor talking to my Apprentice you know there's always like your thoughts in your mind and then there's the thinker of the thoughts you know there's two kind of when you're talking to yourself in your head there's someone talking and then there's someone paying attention so there's kind of two like dualistic identities inside your brain at any given time and I viewed it as like a mentor who is the retired six-time Mr Olympia talking to the amateur The Apprentice who\nwanted to become that and was embodying that and working towards that so when I would talk to myself like come on champ come on you want to be Mr Olympia like let's get after it it was like my future Mr Olympia self talking to myself and when I would be on a treadmill I'd be supposed to do 30 minutes 25 minutes goes by I'm like add bored tired want to go eat breakfast deep in prep whatever and I get off I'd get off and talk to myself like come on champ like is that what Mr Olympia does is Mr Olympia to get out five minutes before his cardio's done I'm like [ __ ] and I drag myself back on finish my cardio and actually do it right same thing with you know a set if I'm aiming for 10 I get eight and I just put the weights down and I'm like what the [ __ ] like you could have gotten 10 maybe I Take 5 minutes do another set that I'm not even supposed to do to hit that 10 just to hold myself accountable or I get right back on and do two more three more reps just to make sure I'm hitting that 10 that I was supposed to but holding yourself accountable and having the proper self talk is important and I don't think this comes from shame I don't think shaming yourself calling yourself a piece of [ __ ] like you fat [ __ ] get after it all these things I don't personally believe that works at all I think if you call yourself a fat [ __ ] and you begin to identify as a fat [ __ ] you will continue to act like a fat [ __ ] so not to use fat shaming as an example at all but that's a huge one that people do you know that eat bad [ __ ] I'm so fat I'm so fat I'm going to keep eating bad like no it's don't shame yourself positive reinforcement talk to yourself from like a oneup position in a positive form hold yourself accountable to be better not to shame yourself for being worse I think that's absolutely huge positivity is [ __ ] massive and I think so many people think driving forward from shame works because it does for a period of time but if you're trying to be a six-time Mr Olympia or do something consistently I truly believe that everything I just listed of building identity a habits a self-accountability the positive selft talk those are the only ways to properly sustain things obviously within that you know the goal of everything I'm talking about I'm trying to focus more on like mental things and the mental side of things and even in the behavior something I didn't mention if I was like Mr Olympia is someone who always has their head on right what does someone who has their head on right do you know they self-reflect they Journal they go to therapy they talk about their emotions and their feelings they let things out they don't hold it all in and these were all part of the identity that I began to build to be create a mind set that could do anything rather than just trying to accomplish one thing and I think that was the most important thing that I kind of naturally built over time and I didn't even realize what I was doing I was just again starting small and building habits creating identity around something I wanted to be knowing I wanted to be Mr Olympia and embodying that next thing I knew I was [ __ ] looking back retiring and I had done it six times and I was like wow like you did it and it was pretty cool so you know there's a lot of these things that I'm going to try to apply to absolutely everything in my life such as you know being a good father defining what that means to me being someone who you know is present when his kids around is emotionally there for his daughter is you know drives them to their games leaves work early because priority is family these little things that are important to me something that I want to Define so I know who I want to be and I'm aware of it and then I can actually act and live it out so yeah that's pretty much it but essentially clear outcome clear goal Google smart goals I don't need to do that consistent identity Define what that identity is start small build momentum and just [ __ ] create an identity be someone who X and Define that very specifically not I want to be jacked I want to be someone who and what are the attributes that you would view as someone who is jacked use that as an example obviously because it's easy for me to use selft talk being positive personal accountability it all comes down to yourself you know I don't even repeat myself it is what it is but yeah this is something that I've been personally reflecting on and I just wanted to share that with you guys I think you know there's a\nlot of lessons that I learned that I didn't even understand I was learning and you know there's two times to learn from something it's from the experience and then from reflecting on the experience and I think from reflecting on the experience is when you truly are able to learn and make changes to your life going forward because the greatest achievement of accomplishing your goals isn't the goal it's who you become and accomplishing those goals so I want to do my best to be able to share a lot of the things I did hopefully help you guys move forward and as I doing my self-reflection on the experience I just lived I'm going to try and kind of share these little tidbits if you will with you guys so sorry for the rant hope that made sense I tried to I literally have like five bullet points on my phone that I'm going off from a 10 minute video however long I'm talking so hopefully it made sense but appreciate you guys thanks for watching"
