yeah no yeah you can't make this [beep] up no it really follows some events though literally no yeah it falls from the [beep] bed there's that there's mold growing on one of my [beep] Vents and they came in and had to clean it off and retape it and we're not talking about little pieces it was like we grew on it the AC kept breaking so the condensation was like pooling and then any just the molding in there oh [beep] that's just blowing and you're like because honestly yeah since last year at all it literally I don't think I had allergies I think it was the mobile phone I don't think you do anything because when you came down the first time was when they hit me really bad yeah yeah so we're gonna break up little pieces of glass and we're gonna put it in his shoes when those cardios here if I won an Olympia living in [beep] mold last year I couldn't breathe couldn't sleep this guy's a little bit this year you know he jinxed it and then he'll be happening we can make you do back with Chris and start with some cooldowns where they look really work on the contractions really really good mind muscles Archer back more okay [Music] arch your back that's it all those elbows elbows [Music] what what's wrong with that oh it's sit downfall of our Humanity that's what's wrong with it I don't mind turning that song again sorry listen to some Christian rock at the gym [Music] during the warm-ups thank you pause it pause it pause good one more like that one more stretch and pull a little lower right there hold down right there right there five seconds three two up slowly stretch good job put your back tighten up your legs ready pull back hold up you feel a little bit of blood in there yeah quarter turn good should I just do the wrong quarter turn this here just just to give everybody a little I don't know why not just make up a new version of it just have your arms so far away from your body what would you if I did that on Stick would you get up and leave I would take my shoe off and throw it see all that [beep] all the Drake concerts of girls throwing bras at him yeah we got some girl just threw a bra at him at a Drake concert and then Playboy like hired her as a model or something and I shoot and then another girl through her bra and it was like a 32j or something yeah some giant says really he like picks it up he's like 32 Jay like someone find this woman right now that's it that dude's [beep] hilarious that's got some back problems probably I don't even know what that number means it's not even the higher the letter the bigger the boobs yeah the wiser numbers and letters 32 is like your waist it's like your waist it goes around that's the circumference across here so you want like a 20 Z no no because you're gonna be this wide you're gonna look like tits on the stick so you want something proportional 32 34 36 depending on how big someone's back is how tall they are I'm a 56. you probably are are you thinking you gotta ask the Geo Ram that's right shout out to Ram we're waiting for our suit jackets nice jacket little can we do another one here yes one more good three good go go go cool let's keep going to join don't don't okay oh wait hold it slow slow slow stretch okay he only spot me a little crooked well it's because I'm pulling on one side it's a little it's a little tough on that bar too it's gonna be asymmetrical oh you'll be you'll live no not CrossFit Pull-Ups didn't he tell you that he wants to switch yes snowboarding championship and everything else he's gonna be working on he said he's gonna start skateboarding during crap wrap you in bubble wrap put a helmet on you and wrap your whole body in the whole wrap I'd still\nhurt myself oh see I know I was like 271 last night after dinner I'm not going to do very many of these I know 268 right now well no if you drink water if I'm back close to 270. let's go see how you do it okay Cross Your Hands bend your knees more bend your knees more keep going keep going keep going keep going not bad actually I feel way more than I thought you're gonna do I thought you'd do like three I feel like I weigh 300 pounds wow you look like your girls 270 oh you are two seven prime directive is I'm gonna have to try to make a topical diuretic for your face that was my Prime director from your uh put on weight without [beep] these growing rub a little bit of topical fat burner on your face yep you're like wow he's 22 body fat but his face looks like he's six weeks now I wish people who have skinny facials are so lucky for that you have another spot what is there another spot you can do without hitting your head on that thing in that bar maybe the skull rack that won't fit this way right because that's too narrow let me know you can try it's just the grip is really smooth you're not going to have any doubt my grip string no yeah hook up hook grip good cross cross cross cross there you go good yeah let's go and then we need help to straighten out your legs a little bit when you start needing a little help yeah that's it that's it good job and that's how you spawn what because normally that's too wide but because of how wide you are it actually is probably right where you need to be yeah yeah so what we'll do is we're gonna start doing those on the beginning I honestly didn't think you would be able to do that many because that's just how heavy you are you know this is the heaviest you are every time you see me every time it seems you lift you're like always suppressed thank you for yelling work out when you're not around well no I forget that you actually used to be an open bodybuilder fair enough you had to win your throw card as an overall wouldn't you I just went overall you're the fifth place got a pro card Justin Rodriguez beat me but you never you never competed an open yeah no until this year about what I wanted secrets you never knew but when you were not here he was like 300 pounds and he just dropped 30 pounds Calvin is that what happened he did a water he did a water cut no what you don't know is the fact that he texted me and says I feel like I'm too good of a shape so I'm gonna make sure to become a fat pig by the time you get here did you say that yeah that's nice uh what we'll do is let's do a row start getting into that reverse grip that stuff that we were working on last year that's right thicken up that back that little lap so let's do a reverse grip then over row switch yes oh okay this whole Archer back control Slow Down slow down further that is it control perfect good that's it let me stop it or the other that's it and last together good job yeah you might go a little bit wider and let's just add a 25 don't go straight to another blade I started leaning forward a little bit further though instead of like pulling here when I do over here I come here pull a little further over my body some weaker obviously but it's a better contraction yeah that's okay just you guys have to make sure you stay arched especially if it's a heavier way before I was I wasn't doing straight legs and I couldn't do it I couldn't row bent over because I didn't have the stability and I started doing straight legs and then all of a sudden rowing became way easier when did you stop doing straight legs when I was traveling all that much oh got it okay come on Chris three four five six four good done good job [Music] good I'll go back a little tax from yesterday's leg day but yeah yeah well normally I wouldn't want you to do back after legs but because you want to concentrate on those machines and I mean the uh those workouts it made sense this time I normally do legs the day before when we did chest yeah but I had just done hamstrings the day before that so yeah it's better to do either chest or shoulders in between what about um overhand how do you feel about just keeping it at this weight and then going into an overhand I feel better about it sure okay let's do that because I just don't want too much pressure on your biceps right now I don't have any biceps really the string but I felt my biceps more in my back I probably have bigger biceps let's go Christopher let's go okay bring the elbows back a little further elbows back up that's it good good contraction excellent much better much better good stretches good job so when you're going early in the set you started bringing your elbows out this way and then the\nminute you start bringing your elbows in you can see a much better contraction going on but I agree okay where are you saying coming from averted but I used to do it purposely or more like trap upper back well because they feel that in yeah but we'll do trapping up her back when we do trapping up her back I know normally this is the rest of my workout two more lat okay we want to thicken up those laughs so those others know control the weight control the weight come on Chris boom elbows [Music] whoa control good good two more two more one more one more got this [Music] he almost broken don't do that 'll be fine that's fine oh it's fun it's broke I broke my back what's that mean I don't know some Mike Tyson breaking his back or something no one knows something like that no it's uh from that movie um The Longest Yard oh I think I broke it in my back yeah [Applause] mostly just all together what you've been doing on your because you've been traveling and all that [beep] like have you just I haven't been traveling recently well I mean for the last two or three weeks you haven't but before that you were traveling a lot so were you back for six weeks how do you think I'm so [beep] jacked right now this is jacked yeah okay um so have you been just doing a lot of the upper back with mid-back I'm doing mid and upper to my end and then on hamstring day I'll do like two lap purely lab focused exercise okay so have you been when was the last time you did when I'm done mother Rose [Music] definitely two are chest supported okay so let's do that so that you're obliques don't kicking so obliques because the way I pulled very similar no that's gonna pull higher yeah but that's what I'm saying I normally do barbell high for upper or dumbbell High forever not both what we're gonna do both we're gonna do one upper one lower a little bit stretch and pull excellent stretch pull good Drive dude you're actually a lot look stronger than you looking that's usually the goal I try and walk around look as skinny as possible okay make it harder up and hold it there you go come on pause itself pause stop good come on just a little longer good that's perfect pull good right there drop that [beep] on my feet go partials good one two keep going keep going three two that's it turn around I'm wearing the future himself and us any problems with hearing Oh I thought you're gonna say my toxic sarcasm that for sure is I don't have to ask about that one that's not good um [Music] hold up five seconds hold it good job good turn my labor I'm doing that doing it for our last friend yeah I've been practicing my Vacuums in my office got a small waist what are you getting signed by Dyson yeah I knew you're gonna say something like that I had to because there's got to be like a lead-in somewhere there's got to be a shitty joke somewhere yeah mine are less Shady videos maybe so but less shitty means about 20 sometimes okay let me ask you this um somebody overrides your [beep] what's that [Music] pull over pull over pull over on the machine I'll pull down is that thing I don't know a straight arm pull down is also this way full over action comment below it's a pull down or pull over say Chris is right it's a pullover Chris is always right [Music] [Music] [Music] instead of you pulling like this we're putting out here and it feels so much better yeah and also the best thing about it is that with the Canon equipment you can actually just change up the angle slightly so just changing up a little bit of that supination of the wrist can cause a lot better contraction [Music] good eight good full press good two Arch Arch Arch pretty good [Music] [Music] cool yeah [Music] good but let's keep the weight the same let's change up the angle what I want to do is we're going to feel a little bit of a variation did it feel for that feel the difference from the hand position yeah okay cool cool there you go good [Music] excellent keep going keep going [Music] Drive good it's like you're on stage you sound like you're on stage you're showing your Christmas tree oh that's it two more two more one more okay two parts two partials one more that's it good don't that one it's all about the girth [Music] three more foreign nice stretch did you raise the weight yeah no come on this [beep] [Music] and specify holy [beep] come on good oh stretch it stretch keep that core tight Drive good keep going keep going go [Music] good good just stretch and pull [Music] good [Music] go [Music] that's it a good stretch and stretch okay when you go up arch your back a little bit like that but keep your chest down but arch your back what does that mean s I'll show you go [Music]\nfull so what that means is as you're coming here to pull and you're just going here stretch but make sure you get your chest up a little bit when you stretch you told me to Arch my back without putting myself so if you arch your back but don't put your chest up no don't lean up too hot [Laughter] lift weights is all you know I take I pick up I put down now he's losing his brain cells on top of his hearing it's that mold I thought it was getting better too actually you probably are getting better it was rough for a while I actually had some serious brain fog for a while I mean you were like literally like had such a histamine reaction that you were just constantly like nose was all plugged up eyes were watery you travel you get better you go home and you're like oh my God no it sounds a lot better now helping your sleep helping your recovery that's good job good yep you're doing a good job of keeping your back arch good March [Music] scratch and pull that's it play your course you get a little bit good job good job one more set underwater stretcher like that stretch stretch stretch and cool excellent stretch press stretch Chris that's it bit back on stage let's go big back on stage let's go start good stretch up up up good two two straps one more [Music] pull pull good job excellent let's put some uh hypers get the lower back finished I look back it's like a pump full of blood you're like let's work on the lower back we're gonna just gotta do the hypers brother do about three sets of hypers four sets of hypers finish that off how's it feel good good you know I do a like a lower backish stay on my hamstrings too right yeah I'd rather just be here to do it so do you have a high percentage girls on it okay we'll go kick her off come on [Music] no these I need like a 600 pound deadlift for the Olympians you need it it'll boost my ego I pick up I put down what do you do for a living I pick up I put down that's it [Music] how I feel no just lower backwards this could be pumped what it's good to be pumped oh it's like knowing your spine's like really over Arch oh it's cramping yeah what happens stretch it a little bit and it's just not meant to be stretched [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] okay [Applause] just I just mixed some [beep] intro with protein and I don't know who did it but someone mixed the unflavored intro with flavored intro and now I'm drinking like lemon lime cookies and cream protein that's [beep] disgusting it's not good at all why don't you make some new new one it's a vodka it wasn't like five seconds ago I didn't want to waste it disgusting it's not like I own the company I can just get a Traeger tonight but too much work I want to try this I tried it and it wasn't good and now I'm just getting it down because they need it almost like sewage cookies and cream cookies and cream lemon lime okay for you or me for me my battery's flashing so you gotta three two one go battery slashing yeah okay so he stops no no I thought he's phoning at you all right guys got done day three we just got done doing an amazing back workout because we were able to get my muscle connection because it's all about time under tension and mind muscle connection and not just throwing around heavy stupid weight so you got to be really about it's got to be really smart about your training how'd it feel good form and then intensity that's right perfect form then you can add intensity yeah then you can add weight as you're able to get stronger instead of just trying to do it all backwards you go heavy your form's falling apart you're more likely to get hurt and you're not going to be able to grow so all you're trying to do now is assess where Chris is at for this prep and I think we need a really good job because you're in a good spot yeah no I feel good a lot stronger and bigger than I was last year going in the crap at this exact point you came down about 16 weeks out last year yep right when we started working through working the other yeah 15 16. so much better than last year yeah yeah you're heavier you're leaner you're stronger and I feel like it's a really good starting point getting ready to rock and roll yeah so now it's Max deadlifts what's that Max Douglas now it's about the max deadlift because Kelvin says it's about not stainless I just need a 600 pound one so we're looking for a new videographer by the way because Calvin's not gonna be able to do anything for six weeks you know so go ahead hit me up we're looking for a new videographer Calvin's gonna be injured reserved we're actually killing him but yeah that's a wrap on this three-part series thank you guys for tuning in we're gonna be heading to Dallas in x amount of\ntime that I will not tell you so no one finds me there but we'll be there eventually for some more training sessions so we'll get a few more H dub time sebum workouts coming in but yeah that's what's going on so peace out thank you guys for watching catch you later"

    "text": "Back & Triceps Session ? Transcript \nSource: YouTube (Christopher) ? Back/Shoulders/Triceps gym session \nNote: Lightly cleaned for readability; pacing/count cues preserved. \nthis is another one on back and triceps \nYouTube Christopher but yeah we're going to the \ngym been pouring rain so I always feel much more tired on rainy days I don't \nknow why my eyes are just like heavy but I slept good last night so it's good Justin's got the new pink lemonade bum \nenergy coming to convenience stores near you soon hopefully so go in your gas \nstations and tell them you need B Energy there maybe we'll get them there but we're going to hit some back some \nshoulders that's it hopefully don't get soaked on the way over there try to wake up and roll it five four three two \none good long arm long arm reach reach reach reach then \ntwist like that doesn't hurt but it feels weak and that's 10 okay \nbut what about pain give it a number for pain \nthree okay so it's not not too bad okay it's the more weight though it's like yeah then you feel it uh both arms \nshoulder blades down bring your arms back as far as you \ncan so tell me how this side feels different nothing right now a pain but \nit feels like tighter \nokay that that little motion there in about right here yeah it's kind of more \nwhen you like getting pulled out and that's when you feel it yeah okay go sh it off lay on your back wait from here do you notice changing hand positions if it does \nanything or no not that I noticed okay so you'll just be here you're going to push into me and then you're going to \nlift off with about 50% so push into me like down that way like you're doing a reverse we'll do it like this I'll be \neasier push push push push push push push now \nlift it's definitely\nbetter still in there but it's better \nslightly we'll keep playing with it by the time we get everything warm uh and we actually get to that we'll we'll get a better idea of what it is good four three two one \ntwo is there a pause at the bottom of this one or no pause just don't rush out of it two more \ntwo one four three two \nyep 3 \nfour one more four three two yep \nI feel fine with this much l yeah do a couple more just get a lot of \nblood two one more and you can dip them lower as \nwell for yep like down there exactly I feel that \nmy mid back yeah head back drop the elbows \nmore y low low low lowow low like that then up so that's technically what it \nshould be but we'll do what you you've been doing for it there's no reason to change at this point so just do whatever is comfortable yep and let \ngood all the big ones are on the bottom yeah you did \nhundo all right here we go quick up four three two one yeah take \nyour time out top four 3 two one then speed four 3 two and go four 3 two yep that's \ngood doing another warmy here this is the like three three with \nthe intensity spread if it's knocked out in two it's knocked out in two and the final ones are rest paws go to failure \ngo back in 15 seconds later what do you mean if it's kned out too uh like if if \nyou're at a peak glow by set two then it's then we'll do the rest paw then or then we'll do the rest pause then yeah I \nmean I'll need a more warm up here than I will there okay you want another one here then let's go um depends how much \nlighter you think I should go I still felt light \nokay if you legitimately hit the hundreds I would imagine with the change in Tempo \nwhat did I just do that we'll end up doing the '90s for more reps I don't think we'll end up jumping up to the 100\n10 the 110 like going up and load what was the last load I just did you just did the 60 60 yeah so we'll hit an 80 \nwe'll hit an 80 see how that feels 4 3 2 one good how's your shoulder \nfeel on that fine fine okay we'll start on the Arnold \npress uh how does it feel kicking them up fine I used to kick you up \nlike 130s or normal so this is light this is very \nlight and then just if anything feels different right to left any uh any \ncommunication will help me have a better idea of like what's going on with the shoulder I have some ideas right now but we'll uh we'll play around with \nit 4 3 2 1 2 4 3 2 \n1 4 3 2 one po 4 3 2 1 one go 4 3 2 one \ngo 4 3 two one go four 3 two full \nextension 4 3 two one up one \nmore two one \ngo done there Four 3 2 \none two four 3 2 \n1 4 3 2 \n1 Four 3 2 one there's five four 3 2 \n1 6 \nseven good keep driving the shoulder down think about reaching there you go now go four 3 two one two more \ngo give me one more here and go four three two one good \nperfect so because we're leaving room in terms of \nintensity for the later portion of prep because the tempo is more \ncontrolled and because the shoulders are going to respond to Tad better to a higher rep range we're going to do the \n90s even if it falls between 12 and 15 in this case that'll be good that one \nwill still tick to uh s to the 10 and then this one has the rest pods \nbut the set is the first like mini set is complete when you can't get full extension so make sure you still get \nfull extension control the four down and on the last one don't drop still get the four down they'll go to your knees it's\n10 seconds you'll kick them up and you're rolling by the time we get to 15 the same thing yeah yeah same \nthing 4 3 2 one quick Four 3 2 1 2 4 3 2 \n1 4 3 2 one four 3 two one spe spe spe spe four \nthree two one up four 3 2 one all the \nway up all the way up four three two one up four 3 two \none up all the way all the way go another four three two one \nup four three go for one more and \nup okay four three two 10 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 \n3 two start kicking them up aggressive out of the bottom holy \none to three more Four 3 two one two four three two one up \nup up up up four 3 two one up up up up \nfour down three two that's good oh we \nalready pumped the shreds oh just pure delt pure delt like in a good \nway good delt good delt oh good we like good delt it like every part of \nit was just like the delt was just holding it that's good I'm telling you this the \na series at least for this phase that's the that's the ticket is the time under \ntension and the eent that's what we want so that's good would you say that like the biggest low hanging fruit for most \npeople and success and bodybuilding trading is time M tension on the \nentric 100% you create more muscle damage in the Ecentric that's not the \nonly way to get hypertrophy but that's one of the main ways you get hypertrophy yeah and Ecentric are one of the fastest \nways to build strength and strengths the mother of all qualities for hypertrophy especially if you get stronger so \nEcentric it's all \ncorrelated 10 reps try to Arch the back low back s try \nto Arch your back one \nmore see if it feels better for you instead of doing both feet right next to each other whatever side is growing pop \nthat foot back slightly cuz in the bottom instead of being here you're this\nis tucked just the very bottom is yeah which is fine but it's not as stable not \nand I don't want to like light your low back up yeah but \nwhat loads have you been using with this and what was the tempo like I think I was doing like 110 110 \nokay good on the shoulder uh whatever stance is more \ncomfortable I'm indifferent just whatever you feel more stable in but if it's both feet next to each other we can \ndo that doesn't make a difference feels more comfortable to do feet beside each other cuz I've always done it do that then that's fine here we go the top go \nthree two I want three more big contraction squeeze squeeze squeeze three two Big Stretch pause speed three \ntwo keep the sternum up sternum up and go three two one that's \ngood so especially for you making sure that your midback is nice and developed \nwhen you row it's not to say we can never do this but if you're rowing like this and you're not getting this extra \nscapular depression and keeping your sternum up then you're missing the shortening of that and like we talked \nabout what moves the most or moves first a lot of time is uh recruited the most \nobviously is why my back's wide in the lat I don't have the same thickness there so you being able to row and keep \nthis here and get this as opposed to just this will'll make a difference in the \nmid but that was good that was good we'll \ngo two to two and a half minutes we'll hit another one same thing and then \nwe'll move on 3 2 one dead stop good sit in the \nstretch pause then go good and go three two two one pause go 3 \n2 one pause go good you got three \nmore two elbow just a tad higher pause up and back three two one five \nretractions back and down five stretch four good minimize the turn three just \nthis two back one more one good H yeah that's \ngood that's good three two one \ngo \ntwo three as long as it feels good you can speed up the Ecentric ATT\nTad you can speed the Centric up a tad if it feels good \n5 three two one go six three two one \ngo good good stretch big squeeze there we go two \nmore nine last one 10 three two we're rolling in 10 \nhere we go drop it 10 9 8 7 six get \nset and let's go three two same stretch \ngo two three two one go three three two \none four good control three two one \ngo let's go two more two \none more \ngood 9 8 7 Get Set let's go eight reps \nthree two one two three two \none 3 three two one four good \nfive last three \nthree squeeze squeeze squeeze make it difficult \ntwo one three two one that's good all \nright all \nright one more of those now we'll go shoulders 75 seconds and we we hit 3 two one squeeze the dumbbells three two 1 3 2 1 3 2 1 3 2 1 3 2 one speed control the top good reach three two one \ngood Tad higher and control it three last two two nice and controlled push away push away two good 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 chest \nup push away three two one \ntwo right back up three right back up four Reach For Me reach for me three two one go control it three two \none go another control it good done 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 two let's go 3 2 1 two two right back up \nthree four let's go stay in there five right \nback up six you're recruiting the muscle fibers you want right now get as much as you can out of it right back up control right back up one more one more get up\ndone that's good okay now we got rest that's good though that's \ngood one more on the pull over and then we'll come back here how was the grip towards the end on the first one the fat \ngrips fine it was slipping on bed yeah sliping a little bit hard for me not to engage my traps uh just in general on these specifically on lateral raes on a standing lateral \nrace yeah or any lateral race one thing we can do is put you on a slight incline \nbench you being here is going to take the trap out of it but it requires more of a stretch you can try it on this next \none it'd be a good thing to know if you feel it more in your delts for future programs so we can try that be less load \nprobably or what will be the same load or less uh slightly less likely but \nwe'll uh yeah we'll go down to the 20s that's \njust such a big drop such a big drop doing four sets already for me it's \nlike oh yeah you're dogging that's the battle well and that's where all the \nlittle the little tricks come out instead of you just being a a victim to \nhow many sets can you do and how many reps we find methods and ways to get the same stimulus but with less or by \nplaying with variables so that it feels fresher yeah so you're not getting the same fatigue eight \ns 6 \nfive four last three \ngood two more two last one big squeeze feel it on the \nway out three two one that's good done with \nthose very nice 75 then we'll try the variation on \nthe lateral race three two \none good come on two more two more get up three two keep reaching one more three two drop those eight 7 6 two good and come back then \ngo four push that down Fast Five \ncontrol six here we go we're getting to 10 seven control Tad \nhigher eight control stretch nine control \nstretch 10 control that's good more or less in the Trap left left\nokay so that'd be that especially later in prep like if your neck starts bugging \nthat' be a really good one to switch that helps you technically it's supposed to be two sets but we're going to do the \nthree sets since we're pulling on the reverse way all right so 10 12 15 and \neach of them should be like an RM like a 10 RM then 12 RM then a 15 RM is it full range or I trying just \npull my re delts or just full yeah your rear delt is going to it's going to work \non that and it'll grow like crazy from it too yeah we'll just go warming here get a feel even just not used to being like \ntucked in like that yeah I felt it like I feel like probably one of those muscles that you said needs to be like \nretaught like post surely how to sit it like just burning in my like inside my joint cap in a good way not like pain wide grip the elbows are going to \npull High I don't want shrugging elbows High shoulder blades are still repressed depressed and the focus is the amount of \nspread you can get in the shoulder blades and then how far you can get them together with elbows back without this \ngoing here three two one two going to get that elbow back \neven further chest up three there you go now control it speed control three two one three two one speed elbow three two \none go fight to control this two one three two \nagain three two one more up up up up up elbows control to good that's \ngood 6 3 two now control the top go 7 \nthree two come on fight it control two \none three more three here we go all the way up all the \nway up control two in the stretch I'll help it control the shoulders pull pull \npull pull pull now control three two \ngood Stones left unturned in the sense of loading to where if we can dial \nloading even a little bit more you'll get an even better stimulus because of how much we had to drop to get the extra \nreps usually like perfect scenario we would have done three plates for 10 let's say we would have done a 10%\ndifference 5 to 10% difference so we would have done like three plates like \n25 and like a five and you would get extra reps whereas we got close to the \nsame so how do we adjust that you're saying just making sure so like part of it is knowing what loads you've done and \ntypically drop too much not necessarily too much but maybe what you're doing week to week like how are we finding all \nthe little ways to improve like are you going to have the best physique possible with the way you're doing things different this year without a doubt in my mind but that's like that's with us tweaking let's say 50% this is looking for another 10% yeah that ju \njust looking at as like okay what are you wanting to do this year making sure no sounds left unturned like those are \nlittle things we can play with but so just tracking it more efficiently tracking it more efficiently and then \njust us having more conversations about how to adjust things yeah which is partially me seeing the loads and then \nbeing able to tell you like okay that was put the loads in one week next week you can like tell me what the drop to Y \njust tell you adjustments yeah but really we can do it in whatever manner we need to like I don't care if it's \nthrough the app it could literally be like it's kind of annoying but like I've even had athletes where it's like like \ntake a picture that was my top set and they just end of the work like send everything over it's like oh that was \nyour trap or your T Bar like okay cool two one and \nout two one good Big Stretch then wrap \ntwo one try to get the wrist back two one \nstretch two one two one good hold it a tad longer \ntwo one out there you go two \none get two more two one back just a tad more squeeze and hold two one that's good right in right in good fast on the way up go 10 keep \ngoing 11 12 13 Even though the rain's suffering \nkeep it going 14 long arms long arms 15 reach for the ground 16 to 20 \n17 18 minimize this push 19 20 \ngood that's good heavy 5 lb dumbbells I know uh where did you feel that\nmost upper back trap come I was feeling in my rear dels the whole time and then my mid traps were pulling a bit when I was arching chugging too much okay this \nis one where we were talking about how you hunched forward you won't get as much midback this one we're \nintentionally trying to not move the shoulder blades as much and just get the movement here \nthis one I want shoulder blade then that one I don't yeah we're pref fatiguing scap retractors and then we extend with \nrud Del two two go push this down once you \nget it in three three four four good don't tuck the chin \nlift five five six six hands closer to the face \nseven seven get it back get it back eight eight little more \nrange nine nine there you go here we go 10 10 that's \ngood 6 \n7 eight nine good push 10 give it a little \nspeed on the whip 11 pumping out now 12 right back up 13 right back up \n14 15 reach reach reach 16 17 reach 18 reach \n19 20 good \nespecially legs typically but yeah yeah you definitely want it far far away from training it's nice in your case with uh \nuh with what you have IG nephropathy just for inflammation mhm it's good for that but yeah it definitely needs to be \nfar away like the people that disagree like oh no like you can do it close to training that I've heard at least aren't \ntrying to maximize everything like there's literally a study that I don't know if it was just published or if it \nmight have been like a 2018 2019 um but they found it was a good way to decrease muscle mass like so the way you can \ninterpret the study calde talks about it like if you have an athlete who has a \nweight cap you could have them do a cold plunge post training MH and then it would like inhibit they like hypertrophy \ngains because it inhibits the inflam uh like the inflammatory process and they can still get like good strength gains \nnot as good but as long as it's far enough away then then you're fine and\nthen the sa is is great like post especially if it's like a far infrared sauna it'll actually increase the effectiveness really yeah you just have to make sure that post trainining you switch from sympathetic to parasym sympathetic bring the heart rate down chill out first and then go into that yeah because if you're go go go go go it's too much I was good \nwith that with prep last year and I'll do it again I'm sure I used to lie on the ground in there in front of a fan and just like do like a meditation or \njust chill for close your eyes breathe yeah and then I saw rattlesnake across the road and I petrified that there'd be \none in the gym with me and then never again never again yeah performance \nis a lot of times dictated by recovery so faster you can recover the better performance you get and my obsession \nwith sleep too \nright what do you want me to say say goodbye goodbye"

    "text": "Bulking ? Video Transcript \nSource: User-provided transcript \nPrepared on 2025-10-26 \nNotes \nThis document is a cleaned, formatted transcript based on the text you provided. Section headers were inferred heuristically from short title-like lines (e.g., questions such as ?How Do I Know When to Bulk??).\nIntro \nWhat is up, YouTube? Today, I'm going to be going over the top questions people ask me on how to bulk. Any questions I get towards bulking, I've kind of compiled in like a top 10, and I'm going to be going going over all of them today so you have them in a concise area pretty much based off my experience rather than just purely science-based stuff. It's everything I've done and learn from my mistakes throughout the years, so you guys can learn from what I've done right and done wrong and hopefully learn faster than I did. First \nHow Do I Know When to Bulk? \nquestion is always, how do I know when to bulk? And I find this such a funny question people ask me cuz I have no [beep] clue when people should bulk. It's very like situation dependent, person dependent, goal dependent. But as a whole, I would say obviously if your goals put on muscle, you should bulk. And if you're not fat, you can bulk. And fat is obviously very different to the average person. But if you're unhappy with the level of body fat you're at, that's super important. I don't think you should bulk yet. Come down to a body fat that you're happier with, maybe a little bit below even, and then work your way back up. But as a general rule of thumb, I like to be like around 12% body fat for men, maybe 18 to 20 for women, but having visible abs for men specifically, it's easier to gauge. So if my abs are still poking through a little bit, then I'm good to go and I know I haven't bulked too far or I'm good to bulk. Next question, tail off \nHow Do I Know When to Stop Bulking? \nthat last one, is how do I know when to stop bulking? And similar to when you know if you should bulk, if you start to lose your abs or if you get too much of a high body fat percentage, I always struggled to say that. I got it that time. Then you know it's time to slow down. There's a few other things like when your appetite is absolutely like in this [beep] like you can't eat at all. It'll be tough to eat when you're bulking really hard. One is completely gone. Sometimes you need to just take a step back. If your lifts in the gym are plateauing, if your weight is stagnating, all these different things, it's kind of time to give your body a little bit of a break, whether it be for a week or a full cut. It kind of depends on your goals and situation, of course. But again, big thing is if you have some abs, you're still happy with how you look, you're not too fat yet, then you can keep pushing that weight. All right. \nMacronutrient Essentials \nSo, how to start? How to start your base calories, macros, meal plan, whatever it may be. The simplest thing and that everybody needs to do in the suggestions quote is he always says what isn't measured isn't managed. So, the more you measure, the more you can manage, the more you can adapt and you know what changes you're making are causing the changes in your body. So, the most important step of starting anyone's fitness journey really is tracking everything you eat consistently and calculate the calories and macros on that. Maybe do it for a week, take the average and see what it is and weigh yourself during all those days as well. So, if I'm 250 lbs, I'm eating 4,000 calories every single day. Then my base to maintain 250 lb is 4,000 calories. So, if I want to lose weight, I'll go under that. If I want to gain weight, I'll go over that. Typically, you'll increase by like 5 to 10, probably like 5%, I would say. I usually go on more so like 300 to 500 calorie increase when I start a bulk. So, if I'm resting at 4,000, I'll go up to 4500. And then from there, you count your macros through that. Obviously, most important if\nPROTEIN \nyou're trying to bulk put on muscle is protein. And you don't need quite as much protein when you're bulking because carbs are actually protein sparing. When you're really low carb, your body is going to use protein for energy. Whereas, when you're really high carb, you have all the carbs to use for energy. So, your body uses the protein to build muscle. Therefore, they're like they help you spare protein. So, when you're in a low low carb deficit, your body's pulling from your protein source in order to make energy, not just rebuild. You need to add more protein to make sure that you're actually rebuilding properly as well as getting the energy from it. So, I stick to a minimum of 1 g per pound of body weight. Everyone knows that number. It's so simple. Just stick to it. Make sure you're at least hitting that. And that's what you prioritize. So, then you take that. I'm 250 lb. That's 250 g of protein with four calories for every gram of protein. So, multiply that by four. you're already at 1,000 calories. And then if I'm trying to hit 4,000 calories total, then I'm going to take 20 to 30% of that total caloric intake and make that into fat. And so whatever that is in fat, I'm not that quick at math. What is that? 20% of 4,000 200 800 800 quick math. So that would be 800 calories for me in fat. So then I have 1,000 calories of protein, 800 calories of fat, and then I just fill the rest with carbs. And then there's your macros right there. That's literally how simple it is. And the most important thing is to continue to track going forward. Make sure those are hidden with right. Track your body weight. Look at yourself in the mirror. Monitor your lifts. If things are moving in the direction you're happy with, just keep doing it. That's what's important. If you start to lose weight or you're not gaining weight fast enough, you add a little bit more calories. And then you keep those ratios the exact same. You can play with that. A lot of people do better with higher carb or higher fat. And you kind of rotate through. Typically, most people do that 20 30% fat. That's what's worked best for me. I enjoy eating a lot of carbs, not crazy amounts of fat, but also as I get to the end of my bulk and I'm eating like 6,000 calories, I'll start to just cover things in olive oil just because I need anything to get those calories in. So, obviously, there's a place to start, but the number one thing in being successful at anything is knowing that you're not stuck between these confines. If it works for you, it works for you. That's all that matters. Doesn't matter if someone else tells you what to do. If I do it or not, works for you, you're making muscle. The other thing to take note when you're counting your protein, the 1 g per pound of body weight, is there are some extreme cases where when people are really like underweight, like if you weigh 100 lb and you're a male and you're tall and you're just really skinny, you might want to bump that up from the beginning. And if you're heavily overweight, so you're 400 lb and you don't have that much muscle on you, you don't need 400 g of protein. If you can eat it, I guarantee you, you will lose weight more efficiently having more protein rather than fats or carbs in your diet. but it's not necessarily for putting on muscle. So, if it's too hard to eat, 400 grams of protein, that's a lot of protein, then bump that down to something that's a little bit more appropriate. What you would guess your lean body mass would be and then use that number. It's an estimate. Again, doesn't matter. You kind of play with things as they go. If you're really overweight losing weight, all that really matters is that your calories are below what your basil basil metabolic rate is. All right. Next question is \nWhat Type of Food Should I Be Eating? \nwhat type of food to eat? Cheat meals, clean bulk, or dirty bulk. Rule of thumb for this in my absolute belief is whole foods are the most important thing. Something that grows from the earth, something that caveman could eat, anything like that, single ingredient foods are your best bet. This is because I mean it's just normal food. Much easier for your body to digest. The more food you can digest and the nutrients you can actually absorb from it, the less you actually need to eat to get the same benefit out of it. The less you have to digest, better your stomach feels, the more\nyou can eat. It's all just like a feedback loop to making more gains essentially. And even eating bad food causes inflammation in the gut, which slows everything down, slows your bulk down, your muscle gain down, cause inflammation in your joints, can start hurting you when you're in the gym training. There's a cascade of effects that can come from that. Not to mention that it's just not as healthy for you. So, yes, we're trying to put on muscle, but the healthiest way to do it is often also the best way to do it. So, make sure you're actually focusing on eating clean whole foods and not just going after like a nasty, dirty goal. People \nWhat About Cheat Meals? \nalways ask about cheat meals. Why can I have cheat meal? I want a cheat meal. What's the point of cheat meals? All these things. And over the last like four or five years of my preps, I didn't get any cheat meals. And that was because of what I was talking about before. I didn't want that like gut digestion mess up. I didn't want the inflammation from it. I didn't want to ruin my sleep that night cuz I was full of all this [beep] and have my joints hurt the next day. Everything I was doing was so calculated to be the best that I was like, m I could have a cheat meal calorically and not get too fat, but it's going to have this other, you know, effects on my recovery, my digestion that's just not worth it right now. So, I didn't have those ever when I was in prep. In my off season, I like to live live a little bit. I still eat really healthy though. Like if I go to get a burger, sometimes I get a lettuce wrap, no cheese, cuz I know it's going to mess with my stomach and I make sure I stick with that. But again, it kind of depends on what your goals are. The only point of having a cheat meal is pretty much for your mental sake. If you need like a little bit of like stress relief or a break from it and if that's going to help you, then absolutely it's worth it. Even if you're a professional bodybuilder and it's going to benefit your mind and calm you down and give you a nice like cortisol brief to eat a cheat meal, then go for it. It's not the end of the world. But as me trying to be as the best in the world, I wasn't going to do that [beep] I was like, \"Fuck it. I'm going to fill up on good food, food I know I can digest, just eat more of that, still sleep good, digest good, and be better for it.\" But that like 01% change it's going to make doesn't matter to most people. And even now as a retired bodybuilder, I'd be less tricked on doing something like that myself. So Clean Bulk vs. Dirty Bulk why would you clean bulk versus dirty bulk? I would say people with dirty bulk are just people who don't understand the indepth like minutia of how important every little thing is to your body. So I just think it's just kind of the easy way out. I need to get some calories in. I'm going to throw some shitty food down. It's also a very like a band-aid. The short-term solution for a long-term goal that you have. You just do that for a year, 2 years, even 5 years from 20 to 25. Maybe you'll get away with if you're lucky, but it will start to catch up on you. So, I just don't even recommend dirty bulking. Throw in your cheat meals if you really want them and need them. But clean bulking is the way to go. We're not just trying to get jacked. You want to take care of your body. And when you build that healthy relationship with food that you're nourishing your body, you're fueling your body. You're putting good food in your body because you care about your body. It also makes it easier to diet because then you're not craving shitty foods when you're dieting because food isn't just like a obsessive I can have now or can't have it now. It's actually something that you appreciate and you're putting good things in your body. And when I switched that mindset of eating for health rather than just like restricting now or eating as much as I can now and I was like, no, I'm putting good food to take care of my body. When I started prepping, I didn't even crave shitty food anymore. I was like, I want a little more rice and chicken, but like it is what it is. I'm dieting. And it made it much easier for me. Just a little mindset switch. As I said, it's so case dependent and bulking. Like when I was a 21year-old trying to put on as much muscle as possible. I remember putting on like 20 or 30 lbs one offseason, probably more than that. And I\nwas like 270 plus lbs. Midday. I was like 275ish. And I dieted down to 220. And I was like eating shitty food, messing up my digestion. Didn't care cuz I was 21 years old and I was just pushing things. And that variance made it really hard for me. So I stopped doing that. So this is kind of again back to when you should stop bulking. If you're a bodybuilder, you really only need to go like 10% over your weight. So, I started being 20 lbs over my competing weight, which made it much easier for me to come back and down and make that weight and not stress my body out too much. It made my bulking way more efficient. But I had also been doing that for a decade. So, when you're at the beginning of your career, things are different. And this is why I always say, don't just listen to what I say. Kind of just take knowledge in and try things out for yourself and see what works best for you at this point in your journey. Cuz what works for me won't necessarily work for you. When I was young, I could dirty bulk, do all the things. Same with you guys when you're young and get away with these things. When I had to eat six almost 7,000 calories sometimes, I threw in some dirty food cuz at the end of the day, I just couldn't eat another bowl of chicken rice. I was just over it. I'd have a protein shake, peanut butter and jelly, go to bed, and just it is what it is. Now that I'm 30 years old and I'm a little older, my turn is good, digestion is good, everything is clean food, and you got to be a little bit more strict. But luckily, because I had more muscle mass on me, I didn't have to eat as much food. So, I was actually eating way more food when I was younger than I am now because I've already built such a good base. So, there's always something different going on in your journey. Just grab the basics, top of the knowledge that I'm giving you right now. Start with this, track it, pay attention to how your body responds, and then adapt accordingly because it's that's the only thing that's going to make you successful, understanding your body and being able to [Music] adapt. All right, so next question. And we're in my personal supplement shop here. Best supplements for bulking. Best Supplements for Bulking Number one got to be creatine. If you're trying to put on muscle, creatine is the best muscle ever. It's good for your brain. It's good for energy. It's good for repair. It's good for putting on muscle. It's the most studied sports nutrition supplement ever. If you're not taking it, you're falling behind. There's so many of the supplements that help build muscle, but specific to bulky and trying to work hard. Number one thing I would say is digestion. I have a pretty good array of digestive supplements that you use at different times. One specifically is a glucose supplement, a GDA glucose disposal agent, typically chromium, Burberry, and a few other things in there that help. And this just helps your body actually utilize all the carbs that you're taking. I never took insulin as a bodybuilder. Some people dabble in that. And it's such a anabolic hormone because it allows your body to use more food and shuttle it into your muscle. So, there's more natural supplements to take. Like I said, Hani makes one called Evalog that has digestive enzymes and a bunch of GDAS in it. Revive has one called glucose. That's a stronger version of just the GDAS. Super helpful. You just take them with every single meal. Super easy to take. Other than that, like I said, the digestive enzymes as well as betain HCL. This bad boy right here. A lot of people don't have the proper stomach acidity for them to digest food, especially a lot of protein. When you're bulking like a bodybuilder, you're eating a lot of protein. So taking a supplement that helps like aid your gut essentially so it doesn't have to work so hard itself is super beneficial cuz the average person should not and does not need to be eating 5,000 plus calories a day. So you want to give your body as much assistance as possible to make sure like I said you're absorbing those nutrients you're actually using them and you're able to pass that food through you so you don't get bloated. You can't eat your next meal and then you just start falling behind. So digestion is absolutely key creatine and anything that helps you uptake carbs. Other than that, of course, post-workout shake, protein powder. It's like the most basic supplement in the world, but \nit's so helpful. Do you need it?\nAbsolutely not. Can you get away without it? You're damn good if you can, cuz I always need it both through prep or an off season. And I still really believe that a post post-workout shake is extremely important. I like to get my EAS midwork still and then right after my workout or at least soon getting in like 50 75 g of carbs with 50 g of protein. And I take that all in powder form. It's just super easy to get down. I can eat again an hour later. I know people are like, \"The anabolic window doesn't matter or whatnot.\" Maybe it doesn't. It probably doesn't if you're getting all your food in, but if it makes me 5% better or.1% better, I'm going to do it. I'm a professional bodybuilder. I want to take everything I can. And it's not that hard to drink a protein shake after your workout. And to be able to get that protein in, starts your your anabolism immediately. Your body's not breaking down tissue anymore. You're rebuilding it. Your recovery gets in immediately. your cortisol drops because your body's starting to get into rest and digest phase which actually also helps your recovery and the quicker you get in the quicker you can eat a meal after that and then go to bed earlier to get good sleep. So all super important things to help your gains and some benefits of supplements. All right, so gym Training While on a Bulk questions. People are always asking how to train in a cut versus a bulk and all these things. And at the end of the day, it doesn't really matter that much if you're training really hard and progressively overloading on proper periodization. You're following my app and you're doing all the stuff you already know. But at the end of the day, it doesn't matter that much. But if you take a look at what's going on when you're on a bulk, if you have a little bit more fluid in your body, therefore in your joints, you have more energy. You're recovering a little bit faster, a little bit easier, there's more nutrients to uptake. And a lot of people think lift really heavy in this phase and yes you should lift really heavy but the thing you can actually get away with more so is doing more volume more intensify just a higher level of hypertrophy. So training in a bulk with a lot of food even on refeed days or whatever you want to up your volume and intensifiers on those days. So things like double, triple sets, drop sets, rest pauses, all those kind of things are what you want to do in a bulk because your body can actually handle that much stimulus and recover from it and you have enough nutrients in your body to push that much volume for a longer workout. It's kind of a different thinking than you might think when you're eating more. You want to do more weight, but you actually want to just still be heavy as possible, but more volume, more intensifiers, and it'll get more gains to use all that food. Like I Chris's Training Cycle said, there's no like optimal perfect way to do it, but that's the way I would do it. And to give an example of the way that my year used to look like with training is I would take some time off, which I would be in right now post Olympia if I were competing again. Give my body a break to kind of recover, get back into it, and then I would start rebuilding my strength for a little bit as food still low, not too high. And as my food ramped up, I would try and have my strengths already back by then. And then I would start doing a crazy amount of volume with that base of strengths. They'll get a little bit stronger at the beginning of your offseason. Then my food gets really high. Use that strength, keeping the weights the same. But then you start adding rest pauses, drop sets, super sets, all the kind of crazy [beep] of just like killing the muscle, pushing some more sets past failure, training with the training partner, all those things that would stress your nervous system a little bit more, but are easier to recover when you have more food in you. So that's the way I would get do it. And right at the end of my offseason when I'd be like peak volume, peak hypertrophy, just like hammering my body. And then when my calorie would start to drop, I would actually start increasing the weight a little bit because my volume would naturally have to come down because I don't have as much energy. glycogen stores in my muscle. Got to drop the volume a little bit, but I keep the weight as high as possible because a stronger muscle is often bigger muscle. So, if you already have the size to your muscle, maintaining strength will maintain the muscle, especially with low calories. So, sometimes it reverses what you think, but it's what I did in the last like pretty much of my whole career and it really helped me get strong,\nmake gains, and hold those gains throughout my prep. All right, next question. \nShould You Do Cardio While Bulking? \nShould you do cardio on a bulk? Like I said, everything is person specific, but if I had to give an overarching answer, it would be yes. for many reasons. Especially as a bodybuilder, the bigger you get, you want to take care of your heart. Obviously, cardio is a way to have the best heart health. So, keeping up with that is super important. But also, not caring about your health. If your goal is just to eat more, cardio helps you eat more. The amount of calories you're going to burn from doing 20 to 30 minutes of cardio, it's nowhere near what you can eat. You can have a bite of a sandwich and overcome the amount of calories you do in 20 minutes of cardio. So, it's really nothing to be afraid of. A lot of people like, I'm trying to huge. I don't want to do cardio cuz I don't want to sacrifice gains. That's complete [beep] Unless you're running marathons or biking two hours fasted or doing anything, you're not going to be losing any muscle. There's a few tips that you can do. Like if you are doing fast cardio because you love doing in the morning, I would 100% recommend taking an amino before that just so you're not burning through muscle. Your body at least kicks some proteins into the fish. At least get three grams of lucine, two scoops of EAS or something and you're good to go. Also, one of the easiest things to do, and this is the Stan efforting thing he used to always talk about on his diet, is doing a 105 minute walk after every single meal that you eat. You're not going to burn through the food that you ate. I promise you, you're not even going to be close to it. But what it is going to do, get your digestion going, lower your blood sugar, help your insulin a little bit, allow your body to actually utilize those nutrients that you put in your body, and then eat quicker in your next meal. Like sometimes you eat a lot and you just want to lie there and you feel like crap, like after Thanksgiving, you just want to pass out. But if you actually go for a walk, your body will start moving that food through you quicker and then you can eat again quicker. It's going to help your insulin levels, which will help your body uptake the food better. So there's a lot of benefits that come into it. So cardio good for your heart. It's actually going to help you eat more and it just helps move the food through you. So I 100% recommend cardio on a bulk. I wasn't always the best at keeping up with this if I'm being completely honest. But I did noticed to a te in the years where I didn't do cardio, but I ate as much as I could. My appetite wasn't as good and I put on fat quicker. Not muscle, but fat. When I was doing a good amount of cardio, I could eat more. I felt better. My body was utilizing it for muscle better than it was at adding fat. So, I just noticed a different body composition when my body was doing when I was choosing to do cardio in my season. So, in the end, when I was doing it all the time, I felt way better. And I absolutely recommend it to everyone. Whether you're skinny, fat, whatever. If you're skinny as [beep] do less cardio. If you're fat, do more. Don't overthink it, but focus on your [Music] heart. All right. So, another question I \nHow Fast Should You Gain Weight? \nalways get asked is around how fast should you gain weight? How do you know \nif you're gaining too fast or too slow? \nAnd again, everything is so person dependent. It's so hard for me to even answer these, but I'm trying to give you guys something to go off of. So, take what I say and apply it to yourself in real life and adapt it. But I would say in the range of 2 to 2 lb a week is like good. It's great for gaining muscle. Again, that could be from a beginner to someone who's advanced. So, when I was young and I was like 18 years old training, I could probably put 2 lbs of muscle on if I really bulked and\ntrained hard and went efficient. And it life, it was incredible. It was amazing. And now over the last 4 years, I've maybe put on 4 lbs of muscle doing what I've been doing. And I've been struggling to do that. And that's me guessing cuz I'm always a little bit leaner and not as lean. So it's like my stage weight is variable. But it's really hard. So it really comes down to a lot of different things. But I think what's super important is having a high standard of which you hold yourself to. So your norm of how you look, you should be proud of how you look. You're working out to feel good, to look good, to be good. So you want to be happy with how you look. So if you start from a leaner spot and you bulk and you don't want to change too much from that, you're not going to be too fat obviously versus if you start from a fatter spot, you get a little more fat, you're more fat than that. So having that norm, that high standard to which you hold yourself to that you're proud of how you look is super important when it comes to these things. It's hard to manage tracking body fat with clips or BMIs or all these things. So, if you're taking constant check-in pictures of yourself, put your weight beside it, the amount of food you're eating with that, and you're following along those things, and you're seeing how your body's adapting, you're much better off than just like guessing what's going on. And obviously, gaining weight, there's so many variables that could be when you first start bulking. You know, your glycogen stores are filling up. You're holding on to more water. Carbs make you hold on more water. Creatine sometimes can, but then it typically levels out. So, don't stress about that. I don't want to say that. But there's so many different things that can make you hold on to weight that aren't just fat or muscle. Water, fat, or muscle are the main top three that it's going to be. So, you really need to be careful of what the difference is. If you diet, if you bulk for a year and you put on 20 lbs and then you diet down and you lose 19. For the average person, that's not a very good bulk. If you're like an elite bodybuilder, then you're doing all right. For the average person, you probably didn't need to put that 20 lbs on to gain one lb of muscle. So, try and like just even that ratio up. Again, I hate giving numbers, but if you're putting on 10% in a year, you're doing pretty good for yourself, depending on the level at which you're at. Just keep watching yourself. Don't let yourself get too fat. Be happy with how you look. Monitor your breathing, your heart rate, all these different things are super important. How you feel, how you look, end up going to the final result. So, \nHow Long Should I Bulk For? \nit's all important. All right. Next \nthing is, how long should I build core? \nMinimum time to put on muscle. If you put on muscle, you put on muscle. But there is a the longer period of time you're holding it, the less likely you are to lose it when you cut really hard. That's something to take into account. If you bulk for 2 months and then you cut really hard, you're probably going to lose a good amount of that muscle versus if you're someone who's been holding on to that muscle for a year, 2 years, 3 years, or 6 months versus a 2-month bulk, you're more likely to hold on to it. So, just take that into consideration. I personally liked a longer bulk because I didn't feel like I had to force it as hard and have to put a bunch of food in really fast. I could slowly taper up 250, 300, 400 calories at a time as my body would plateau. I would just add a little bit more food, add a little bit more food, and my body wouldn't put on fat as quick. The slower the change you make, the more likely you are to put on good weight rather than just fat. So, understand that. Take your time. The longer you hold it, the longer your body's going to maintain it. Also, \nGoal Setting\nagain, super important to be specific on what your goals are and definitely not goal hop around. If you're like, \"Oh, I want to bulk.\" And you bulk a little bit and your abs are a little less shredded. I want to cut. and you start cutting a bit and like I want to be bigger and you start flip-flopping back and forth, you're going to make zero progress and there's no point doing that. So start something and commit to it and understand what your goals are. If your goals are to put on muscle, but you hate when you lose your abs and do a really slow, long bulk, very slow increase of calories. Make sure your abs are staying there. Stick to training your abs. Stick to doing your cardio, eating good food, no inflammation, you won't hold on as much water, you won't look as chubby, won't feel better. All these different things. If all you want to do is put on as much muscle as fast as possible, you don't give a [beep] That's the type of person who pushes it a little bit faster or a little bit longer. So, you kind of got to figure out what your goals are and tailor your work towards your goal. All right, last question and another big one, crucial one. I've been here. What \nWhat if I Can't Increase my Appetite? \nif I can't eat enough and how to increase my appetite? Can't is a very strong word. Whenever I meet someone and they come up to me often at expos, they're like 170 lbs. Like, I can't put on muscle. I can't eat enough. I'm like, you're lying. eat more, train harder, and just do it. There's it's always a possibility. If you really can't put food down and you're skinny skinny, there's probably a reason why your cortisol is too high. Your recovery isn't good enough. You need to sleep better. You need to slow down. You need to eat better foods. You need to check your gut. There's there's a reason why people aren't just that word hardgain gainer. People are harder than gaining than others, but there's no hard gainer who can't eat and gain weight. It's complete [beep] You just have to do it and it takes a long period of time. So the biggest thing is I think honestly is like I mentioned the cortisol sleep recovery. If all that stuff is on point, your body can take in food. There's people you hear about stress eating and people who there's no term for it, but people when they get stressed who just they forget to eat all day. A week go by and they eat one meal a day maybe just because they're so stressed out all the time. When your body's in a fight orflight state, cortisol is running through your body. It's not ready to rest and digest. It's why people say rest and digest. You're in a fight fight or flight cortisol. your body's not ready to digest food. It's not ready to take in food. So, it's super important to eat in a calm state to like be in a relaxed state as often as possible to get your sleep in. Sleep and rest and low cortisol is like the secret to bodybuilding. Me, my ability to like lower my stress at times when I was in prep literally won me Olympias. It's so crucial and it comes in so importantly into bulking as well. So, yeah, that would I would say that's the biggest thing, especially post-workout when you're training, you're at a high level of stress, which is important. you're putting your body through a stimulus and the quicker you can switch your body from fight and flight into rest and digest the better you're doing. So after a workout, if you can like meditate, chill, get your protein in, listen some vibing music on the way home. Don't just get on your phone, go back to work, stress yourself out with some stuff, just like calm your nervous system, you'll be recovering better and you'll be able to eat and absorb more nutrients after that workout. Super important. On top of that, just a little tip trick that everyone knows to do, smoothies. \nPRO TIP \nYou're eating your meals throughout the day. Understand your meals that you can get. Nutrient timing is so important. Pairing that with smoothies, it's the secret. If you figure out your body's nutrient timing of when it can absorb certain foods, certain meals in the best way, you're going to crush it. Me, I like having low carbs in the morning cuz then my entire appetite for the rest of the\nday is bigger. A lot of times I used to think, oh, I need a 1500 calorie breakfast to get these calories in so I don't need as much later in the day. But then I can't eat my meals later in the day and I screw myself. But if you have a high highfat low carb breakfast, your insulin levels are actually more consistent throughout the day rather than spiking and dropping and peaks and valleys throughout the day. So, it's a lot healthier for your body and easier to eat your meals later on the day. So, highfat, whole food, high protein breakfast. Start getting your carbs in around your workout. Bulk of your carbs would be pre and post-workout. I could handle them pre and didn't make me tired, so I was completely fine. And some points in the day, have a massive smoothie. I liked having mine later in the day if it didn't fill my stomach up too much before sleeping. You throw in some intraworkout carbs, some protein powder, some whole eggs for some real nutrients, some oats if you want, some peanut butter, almond butter, whatever you want to throw in there. Whatever your body digests, great. Blend it all up. Drink it before bed. You can get in easily 1,200 calories in a shake. And you don't need to get mass and stuff like that cuz it'll just [beep] your stomach up. Unless you can handle it, good for you. But I never could. So, digest or smooth jeez, blend, load your [beep] up, drink a smoothie, digest it good, go to sleep, and get huge. So, another big thing on that, increase your appetite, low cortisol, nutrient timing, big smoothies, take three. All right, so that's the bulk of these questions. I'm sure I rambled on a heavy amount. If you guys have any more question, drop them in the comment section below. I will add them to the next Q&A; that we do. But yeah, these are the biggest tips and tricks I can say that I've done. I've gone through many different phases of my career bulking really hard and not bulking really hard and again I listened to so much knowledge over my career. I took in so much stuff and I tried so many things. The only thing that stuck were what worked for me. You have to like flow with things. You have to like treat bodybuilding like the art it is and understand that there's so many nuances to it that it's dependent on each specific person and only you can figure out that out for yourself because only you know yourself. So trial and error, pay attention, track things. What is it measured? isn't managed. Lock it all in and get [beep] huge. So that's it. Thank you guys for watching."

    "text": "Leg Day Workout ? Video Transcript \nSource: User-provided transcript \nPrepared on 2025-10-26 \nNotes: Lightly cleaned and formatted. Profanity markers left as provided. Narrative order preserved. \nwhat is up youtube today is leg day so it's gonna be a full workout vlog the last few ones you guys were like there's not enough training there's no workout in the sandwich video so today full leg workout i'm gonna try and squat today because i'm trying to not be a [beep] get huge legs again we have mr grant behind the camera you guys may know him from ann's vlogs so he's taking over today so i can get some footage up before i travel this weekend because i'm going to aspen for a week dom is down there right now me and jansen are going we're going to be snowboarding and ripping the hills so hopefully i can get some footage of that but we don't have a grant or calvin or scott coming so probably not a whole lot but for now it's telling huge likes like i said last week i swatted the first time i'd squatted in six months maybe it had been a while but i still was hack squatting and all that jazz so i still had some decent strengths in me but i'm going to be trying to keep those in my routine for a while now at least until i'm dead lifting or doing something every week but we're gonna get in there try and beat whatever i did last week which i think was four plates for 11 reps so i got to get 12 reps and that's the day so in the change drinking a pre-workout get over there get after it all right here we are revive gym leg day still trying to muster up the energy the life inside of me bringing it out of myself because i got a squat i gotta warm up i got some old man knees i got older man hips but we're gonna make will work i haven't even seen this but heads up what you haven't seen it yourself i haven't seen it on myself i just put it on we just had these printed today freshly off the press drop in first week of february we did a whole redesign of savage so hopefully you guys liked it you like the old one but now you can still rock the savage teeth it's a different design i don't know i think it's sick it reminds me of like old school like skater vibes or something this is the skater boy see you later boy look up a good leg there old man knees i got some serious old man knees ever since i took time off training it honestly got worse rest does not help your joints just make you tighten up even more so i need a lot of warm up on my quads hamstrings everything and then we're gonna get in the back little dungeon and get under the squat bar ew i'm worse i get it worse i'm his brother i guess we're not warming up my hamstrings just go outside and clean it up very nicely [Music] yeah i cleaned up your nasty flash off that thing i was trying to use it i'm just coming for my hair you're filthy so laid back [Music] it looks a little better [Music] i don't get pumps anymore it just burns which kind of feels good i guess i just cleaned that you put your crotch right where my face goes if you crouch and said ass when this time wow i guess i'm not doing hamstrings today see other people put their faces there too you know the whole gym is just watching and disgust hopefully we lose some membership and it won't be as busy sorry dom but too busy this machine's a little bit too light the full stack so instead of just doing like 20 reps i do 20 reps and then i go back to like i started with go to failure and i do it twice so do like three sets in one not a drop set but like a rest pause the rest is like whatever however long the other leg takes yeah it doesn't feel great no it feels great but it does now you get to put your face where ian just had his i'm not using that machine wait till they're done\nthis guy not the nice guy you think he is oh that's almost worse to lay on at least it's not your ass do you want to give that a couple are you gonna sit on it now oh not on the new t-shirt that looks like i'm sweating that looks like i'm working they ended up pretending to sweat well it's just really wet ever since i tore my right hamstring it hurts and it cramps a lot but it like built my mind muscle \nconnection for some reason i felt the tear i felt the muscle and it somehow translated to the other leg when i trained hamstrings now they contract so hard it's like they're cramping so pro tip don't try this at home tear your hamstring if you can't feel them it works time to enter the the dungeon layer see if these knees and hips can handle some squats today so i have some good news actually i didn't share this yet yesterday me and courtney went to a surgeon to see if i needed hernia surgery and the good news is he said i don't my hernia is like really small right now it's in my belly button which has a natural hole already so he said he would have honestly had to make the hole bigger close it fully so he's like you don't need it right now if it gets worse it'll get worse but surgery wouldn't help it it would have gotten worse anyways so good news no no i almost did no shoulder surgery that's like foreshadowing in the future no knock on wood my shoulder's still [beep] up but the hernia doesn't need surgery so one surgery avoided it's been a while since you squat when it actually hurts your traps to put it on i'm not gonna use the pad i will not use the pad so i'm not gonna kind of hurt my traps a bit it's right there that's a thick pad too yeah the big girl didn't happen only off camera do i use that it keeps me humble two times two times oh it's not updated i haven't updated one but it's on the wall i got two of these so again it's the memories you know oh yeah remember where you started hmm i felt like what four place felt like last week there we go put the wd-40 on the knees you're all good they're extra loose though so they don't actually help me that much too easily i get them on yeah just to keep you a little warm okay people do always ask me though when to wear sleeves why wear new sleeves personally i'm old i have old man knees so i just wear them for injury prevention when i go heavy but i personally like to warm up like you saw here up until one or two sets before my working set i'll wear no sleeves and that's just so i'm not completely dependent on them i still got a little bit of completely free like weight on my knee and then when i start to go heavier especially now that i'm getting back into squats i throw the sleeves on and i wear really loose ones more just to keep my knee a little supportive and warm so i don't [beep] it up so injury prevention always important i put too much pressure on myself to hit well pressure is a privilege people always ask so hmm uh i lost track 14. oh i think i definitely did it 14. i lost track i was either out of it or was it jesus definitely the song choice huh you can't go wrong with some priestess i can't even talk 160 oh my god that's my fan rep 4 my heart rate's just like spiking just keep going don't stop that's like for me the biggest thing my heart rate shoots up when i trade unless i'm like what's that quite in shape yeah like in all season shape it's still my muscular endurance being able to push so my heart rate going that high because now i'm [beep] fried right now whereas normally i would be able to do that keep my heart rate like just over 100. what the but not right we still did it all right so my method right now of training is i murder myself for one set and the second set is i try and do the same way some sort of uh deload if you will and just because my body still isn't used to like a lot of stress or stimulus this is just my like third leg workout back where i'm actually training properly like this but like third good one so instead of completely frying my system i'm trying to get the most out of the least so my body's still going to be growing because it's more stress than i'm used to and i'm not kind of hurting myself in the process so hopefully i'll get like 8 to 10 on this one and then go do something shitty like bulgarian split squats or something uh foreign [Music] pushing nearly as hard but my head is still spinning what's that heart rate at it fire that's why i gotta practice my meditation i don't know i've been calling bulgarians but squats dreaded but i don't even hate them that much i just feel like social media has like a stigma of hating them but they're really not that bad and they're great for building outer quad glute combo like my glutes get fired on these that's how you build that like big\nback shot with like tight glute creations that'll build that booty [Applause] that's the first time i picked the dumbbell up over 100 pounds in a while watch your toes yeah it's dangerous i need steel-toed socks let's go to the gym [Music] that just burned through the whole leg and there's still another one to go i guess this is why people hate bulgarians eh yeah because you die after one and then you still have to do it again you're too lazy to even stand up just fall back into the chair gas starts to drink burn on empty you run it on empty i need an e85 tune i fill up oh the heat of the moment drops it just felt right uh [Music] right back down still a lot of volume for me right now so pretty much that's a wrap on this like i keep reiterating as i'm like re constituting re adding what am i looking for whatever putting back in training intensity keeping my set volume low so i'm only doing two working sets right now reintegrate it's a good word grant needs to stick around more reintegrate i'm putting in less set volume so i'm only doing two working sets thrown on a drop set if i feel like i could do more move on to the next exercise caller today so we're gonna do hamstring girls now plus calves we're done moving on to my favorite hamstring curl machine that has ever been created the pre-core p-r-e-c-o-r if you're a gym owner please buy one because if i visit i would love to use it but this is the holy grail of hamstring machine so currently i'm doing like a bro split so you guys know what that is trading one body part a day cycling seven day split two days off but normally i do hamstrings and a leg day and i can't even explain what i normally do but i'm gonna switch back to that soon just i was getting back into training i did grossly so right now i'm doing calves once a week but normally i do it twice when i have two like this but still i like to alternate the standing calf raise i'm losing my mind right now and the seated cap rate alternating weeks i don't do them in the same workout i'll just destroy it for like four to six sets and then do the other one the next week and i finally get to a good balance in my category so i don't know anecdotal evidence that it worked [Music] [Music] is [Music] hmm so that would burn the hamstrings [Applause] triple double double drop [Music] hey scott i'm on the show for today are you yep maddie with our chauffeur here he's just bombing rides yeah pun intended got him my car's ready already but so it was like in idle it was like the engine was like revving even on idle so that he had to like adjust some [beep] he thought i had a vacuum leak but but now it's in west palm but i don't want to go to the [beep] west palm so i think i'm trying to leave it there until i get back from because i'm on the way home that's responsible just it's in a side street back a little area you know yeah some photographer is going to find it yeah in that shop there are two r34s so if someone's stealing something they're not going to take mine i realize i've never i never speak about my beloved gtr you know people know i have it and they love it but i just got it down here in florida and it was a shop that works especially with jdm cars so i brought it to them and they did a tune on it did an e85 tune i have a flex fuel kit injectors i have already have the full cat-back exhaust downpipes and everything so it's pushing pretty good right now i i told him to dyno it right now because he was fixing the tune i don't know if he did the guy's kind of he's really smart but he's a little doesn't speak english that well sometimes so either way the car is really fast i think i'm gonna have to find like an empty plot of land or something and just go [beep] rip it for a video because it's pretty fun to drive right now okay [Music] i don't understand that training cabs isn't like as genetic as people think everyone just does it at the end of their workout and they do like oh i'm gonna finish legs with some little bit of calves you know you actually have to train calf like you're squatting or [beep] quad extensions should be the same intensity and 99 of the time your cows will grow may not be huge but they'll grow all right kiddos the wrap on today's workout that's the first full real leg day i've posted on youtube in a long time this is like the foreshadowing message symbolism whatever you might want to call it then i'm finally getting back on my [beep] legs are going up getting stronger squatting every week what's the other thing i've been doing barbell rowing i want to start dead lifting getting back into all the [beep] trying a huge trinket strong chase after the fourth olympia title i think i have 11 months to go right now so still gonna be one of the\nlongest offseasons i have but that just means time to make the most improvements i've ever made so i'm gonna get home probably eat some pasta right now because i'm starving late then head to aspen this weekend so hopefully i can get some footage down there hit rip in the hill if not then uh the thing with snowboarding and filming that i need someone as good as me to film following which normally you don't have you're a good snowboarder yeah i'm okay i can tread down a black diamond i can't do like back flips and [beep] okay so i'm close so we're gonna have fun this week come back lock it down and get back to work so thank you guys for watching i'll catch you in the next one"

Filler words, repetitions, and asides were trimmed for readability while preserving the original meaning and voice.\nIntro \nwhat is up YouTube going to be doing a Q&A; today I suck at doing these on my Instagram story and I always feel like I have more that I want to say and I don't like answering those stupid short answer questions so I'm going to be getting into some questions here probably rambling a bunch maybe not making sense but hopefully this kind of gives you guys an Insight on how I process things my mentality and a bunch of [ __ ] that you guys have been asking that I'm open to answer what is the \nOrigin story of 'Champion Mentality' ? how it developed Origin Story \nchampion mentality and how did it \ndevelop so honestly the or origin story \nis pretty boring it was literally just \ntrying to think of like something to put \non a T-shirt and I've always been a huge \nlike believer that me your mentality \nyour mental state your mental toughness \neverything is a huge driver of success \nand what separates like true like long \nlasting champions from people who just \nwin once or twice and it developed a lot \nmore over the years as I started to \nreally understand just how important \nyour mind is in competitive Sports \nsuccess career absolutely anything and \nunderstanding that you are Your Own \nWorst Enemy all the time you are \nliterally competing against yourself all \nthe time and that the champion mentality \nisn't so much about being a champion and \nwinning trophies but it's about having \nno quit like I said in my Olympia speech\nit's about giving your all giving your \nbest setting the standard for yourself \nso that you are putting in your best \nwork to get your own best result whether \nyou win or lose you're competing with a \nchampion mentality to be the best \nversion of yourself it's kind of what \nit's developed into and I mean more \nevery year I try and learn more about my \nmental state and that's my Champion \nmentality hardest part of Olympia \nHardest part of Olympia prep (mental health) prep I mean honestly there's a lot of \nhard Parts but if I'm going to be one \nthing that just jumps in my head so I'll \npick that is probably the battle \ninternal battle I have in my mind about \nmy health partly because of what I stuff \nI've gone through in the past but also \nif you're a bodybuilder and you cana at \nhigh level and you have absolutely zero \nconcern for your health you're probably \nlying and denying how you feel or you're \njust stupid cuz obviously it's you're \nputting a lot of stress on your body \nyou're doing a lot of so it \ndefinitely takes a toll on me and \nsometimes I get in these moments and I'm \nlike like is something happening\nthere something wrong like why am I \ndoing this just to step on stage and \ncompete like is it worth it and I get in \nthese head battles like that and that's \nwhen I know I need to be doing my health checks blood work everything making sure I'm healthy I'm working with a new \ndoctor now and making sure everything's on point so I can like instead of \nthinking I'm feeling good I know I'm \ndoing everything I can to feel good and also just learning to not live in fear \nbecause anything can happen at any time in your life and if you choose to do \nsomething then do it don't do it and \nthen like stress about doing it or you \nmight as well not be doing it at all cuz \nI don't want to live my life like that \nwhat would you say is the best way to \nSupersets vs one body part at a time make good Gams super sets or focusing on one body part at a time I mean if you're talking about super setting two \ndifferent body parts I would say \ndefinitely focusing on one body part at a time I'm a huge believer in like the \ngood old bro split type workouts where you just destroy one body part train a \nfull intensity on that day other every\nother style of workout Works was well I \njust like that style and I think you \nshould be putting all your focus and \nenergy into like each set that you're \ndoing not worrying about oh I just did a \nset of chest I'm a super set with back \nlike to me that's insane you haven't \nrested enough to give all out for both \nsets but if you're talking about super \nsets as in the same body part in a \ndifferent range of motion like if you're \ndoing a bicep curl and you go from a \nstretch position arm kind of at your \nback behind you into like a preacher \ngirl in front of you where you're a \nlittle stronger then that has its \nbenefit but the way you worded it saying \none body part a time I would say yes one \nbody part at a time how's the \nBalancing business ownership and Mr. Olympia Balance \nbeing a business partner SL owner and Mr \nOlympia honestly this is something I \nhave been struggling with in the last \nlittle bit and I think it's just partly \nbecause it was new and know my whole \nlife I've only had like not my whole \nlife my whole competing career I've had \nabsolutely one focus and all I really\ncared about and that was competing and winning and that's still my top priority right now it's still my number one goal but I have other things that bring me a lot of fulfillment and happiness as well such as business and raw and tum Fitness and everything else I'm trying to build right now and other things that are coming soon and I think it struggled cuz it was something new and I was kind of bouncing around not sure whated to do and not sure where I should put my priorities and while bodybuilding \nselfish the business I have a lot of partners with I felt like I almost owed them a little bit of like to do more work and be more involved do more like that and over time now I've been like if I really want to help them right now the best thing I can do for \nbusinesses and my own career myself are to be the best bodybuilder I can so I had to sit down and really figure out what my priority was and I had sit there I like would you rather business or Mr Olympia and without a doubt Mr Olympia so with that I've had to rearrange like my thought structure throughout the day so if it's like going to be a long day\nlots of work or something like I got to \nleave early not going to the office \ntoday if it's a shitty leg day or \nwhatever and make sure that I have full \nenergy for my workout and I \nalso they're like it's it's my choice \nreally I don't have to be going in there \nand doing as much as possible but I \nenjoy being a part of the business as \nmuch as I can be so just finding that \nbalance and learning as I go but it's a \nnew process and when I get into prep and \nit really gets serious and I'm getting \ntired I'm just going to put all my focus \nin the bodybuilding take a step back and \nluckily I have a amazing team and \npartners that I trust to do absolutely \neverything as perfectly as can be done \nwhat are your \nFocus points for this year's Olympia (mental & physical) Focus Points \nyear's Olympia mentally and \nphysically uh mentally I would say one \nof the biggest things always every year \nI want to be present as possible \nthroughout my prep not just the end I've \ngotten really good at being present in \nthe peak week and on stage and just \nreally enjoying every single moment and\nI want to be a little better at that and prep when I'm going through some stress and like that and like kind of \nenjoy the process of what my body's going through cuz I'm going to look back at these days and be like that was some crazy that was awesome so I want to be able actually enjoy that and I also want to be able to not live in fear and stress like I talked about in my health I want to learn to just take a step away from that understand that I am in control of my health doing absolutely everything I can and there's a lot of new stuff with this doctor I'm working with now to help Excel my health even more and keep it even better and last year with the healthiest I've ever been so I'm like you just did it like just \nlive in that positivity if something \nhappens you'll deal with it but you're not going to expect it to \nhappen and then physically um number one thing that comes to my mind is I want to Peak better this year I think in the last 48 hours 24 hours of the Olympia I kind of like lost my look a little bit I ran a little too flat I was afraid to \nhave any sodium cuz I happen in years in\nthe past and I think it kind of took a \naway from my look a little bit and I \nthink I'm going to need that extra Edge \nto win another Olympia cuz the \ncompetition's getting really tough and I \nmean also obviously I want to keep \nbringing up specific body parts like my \nback and my arms and probably be \nprobably practice my posing a little \nmore this year cuz I never seem to do \nthat what if you want to be the youngest \nIs it wrong to hop on gear at a young age? ifbb pro is it wrong to hop on gear at a \nyoung age absolutely yes because I'm \ntelling you right now when I was young I \nthought it would be super cool to be the \nyoungest pro the youngest Mr lumpia the \nyoungest whatever no one gives a flying \nI was pro at \n21 on the Olympia stage at 22 I believe \nand no one knows that no one cares no \none remembers a year a week after it \nhappened people were like wow look how \nyoung he is and then no one cares do you \nwant to be the best of something for for \nsomeone who's young or do you want to be the best period personally I want to be \nthe best period not just the best young \nperson to do something so\nage don't hop on gear learn the basics \nget strong enjoy the gym and take it all \nslow why do people consider Sumo \ndeadlift cheating and do you well they \nconsider it cheating because it is \ncheating scenario you can compete and \nIf you could win any Olympic medal, which sport and why? win an Olympic medal what sport would \nyou Cho shoes and \nwhy I think Winter Olympics I would do \nsnowboard halfpipe I've always love \nsnowboarding and I Love Shawn White um \nand Summer Olympics 100 meter sprint all \nthe way just to say that you're the \nfastest person in the world would just \nbe awesome what would you say is the \nDriving factor between success and failure \ndriving factor between success and \nfailure don't be generic I feel like I \ncan't not be generic because the reason \nthings are generic is because it was a \ntruth but there's not a lot of crazy \nthings I don't know if about success and \nfailure cuz a lot of people can be lucky \nand successful but I think a huge thing \nsome people lack others not need more of \nit but is you need to believe in \nyourself like absolutely and fully know\nthat you believe in yourself and need to believe in yourself from things from doing things such as or having an understanding that if you are doing everything at the best of your ability that's in your control then you know you will be successful from that and then that kind of creates a release of anxiety of the stuff that's out of your control and you just focus on what what is in your control I think all really successful people have a mindset that can detach from whatever they their control whatever might happen or come into your life and only focus on what they can do and doing that at the best of their \nability hopefully that's not too generic \nFavorite anime \nWhat is your favorite anime \nday are there any new flavors coming for raw products we're coming up with two products coming in lemon lime we got a chocolate peanut butter limited edition protein coming we actually we have a lot we have a a board up of like new drops every single month but the next one I believe is lemon lime and we'll be announcing all the flavors as they come\nbut we got a lot a lot in store what \nWhy grow the mullet? \nmade you grow the mullet so honestly the what made me grow the mullet started with the mustache and I shaved my facial hair into a mustache literally as a joke thinking it would be ugly and it would be stupid and like trying to like do something kind of funny and I ended up kind of looking good and catching on people been like wow that's classic like that coool so I rocked it and it just became my thing now I won't compete without it and then the hair was the same thing I'm like all right the \nmustache mustache ended up being cool what can I do that's actually going to be ugly and stupid and I was like it cut your hair into a mullet and just like Let It Grow and when I was young I had I had hair that flipped out and I always wore hats I would tuck behind my ears and flip it out but I hated having long hair on the side of my head cuz I don't have like nice hair here it would get like frizzy so having a mullet I really need a haircut right now but having a mullet got rid of that and it let me keep the flow in the back and it\nactually ended up looking cool so I kept it as well been rocking it what are some \nHow do you manage stress? things you do to manage stress um good question uh in prep well still I see a therapist less frequently now but I have I do see a therapist I think that can be so beneficial to anyone even if you don't think you're like you need it it can help you just be more successful and build a stronger mindset it gives you someone to talk to that an unbiased opinion that you can just share anything with like any thoughts that you might not feel comfortable sharing with even close ones cuz they might be about them or whatever or fears you want to express it just helps to get them out so that communicating as well whether a therapist or with a partner when I talk to things Courtney that I'm trustful about you just I just feel better she's not doing anything but if I can just express it I feel better and I'm also naturally an introvert at heart I don't always I like being around people like I love people but I need some sometimes where I'm just like alone like right now Courtney been gone for like 3 days she's\nin Arizona and I've had this time like alone and I feel like a little bit reset like my batteries are recharged and I kind of helps me when I'm stressed out there's usually Lots going on I need to just detach be alone and just like calm my mind and understand that like oh the you're stressing about usually \nisn't that important and if it is then you should be doing something about it \nFavorite sneaker of all time favorite sneaker of all time probably Jordan one Low's I love the highs but they're just like not as easy to wear all the time the Jord one low is just a \nFavorite Kanye album \ngoat what is your favorite Connie album uh My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy for sure what advice would you \nAdvice for young lifters \ngive to Young lifters people always asked this and I finally thought of a decent question when somebody asked me at the gym the other day in person and is to focus on the basics focus on the absolute most basic principles of \nlifting and you will be very successful if you focus on form execution mind\nmuscle connection \ncontraction everything like that just at the best of its ability you will be a lot stronger for it if you're trying to think of like new fancy exercise like chest pressing to the side and crazy LP pullovers with wrist attachments and cables and all these setups you're just sinking on the wrong spots if you but if you focus on intensity and execution form mind musle connection that's really all you need you can stick with the most basic exercise do the same forever but if you're training harder and more effectively then you'll benefit from it a cool side note a cool thing that I've heard a bunch of times but the number one thing Michael Jordan started with in practice was chess pass which you would say think it's the most basic thing you would do but it's just sticking to the basics and nailing those things getting those perfect because at the end of the day the flashy cool different crazy things aren't really what you apply every single day but something like a chess pass how many times in a game do they shoot a chess pass how many times do you just need to bench press cable\nfly squat simple things that you can \njust do perfectly and effectively at \nHow do you stay motivated at this stage? this stage in your career how how do you \nstay motivated this is definitely \nsomething that has come in to been a \nlittle bit more difficult in recent \nyears I kind of like feel like I've \naccomplished a lot of what my wanted to \naccomplish and it's almost like creating \nnew goals in my head that I need to \nchase after new difficult tasks that I \nneed to do and it's partly it's \nnitpicking how I looked in years past \nand understanding that I still haven't \nlooked exactly how I want to look and I \nwant to get on stage looking like almost \nperfect at least once before I retire so \nthat kind of edges me to do in a little \nbit better that I wasn't doing properly \nlast year like I was talking about I \nwant to Peak better also just sitting \ndown and like I said picking new goals \nthat it's going to be I wanted to win \nthe Olympia I wanted to Olympia twice I \nwanted to have the most classic Olympia \ntitles I wanted to win was a perfect \nscore I had these like goals and I've \naccomplish all of them now and now it's\njust like what do you want next and I really would love to be like remembered as to the end of time is like one of the goats of classic physique and I want to really like leave my legacy on classic Physique in the \nso my goal is to really accomplish that and that's kind of keeping me motivated right now so I'm trying to put my focus on fine-tuning things chasing stuff I tell myself in my head that people I'm competing as are getting better and better and that they're coming up after me and that I need to push myself more and more and just trying to remember why I started all this cuz I just love \ncompeting I love bodybuilding and I want to keep improving being the best version of myself vert height in high school did \nVertical jump in high school a football combine and I did did a 41.5 in vertical jump and I remember people who shot their pants when I did \nthat and they're like who is this kid and sadly I wasn't that good at football but I could jump damn High favorite \nFavorite cheat meal \ncheat meal is\nprobably uh Thanksgiving \ndinner I think yeah it's the same in \nCanada and us obviously I just had it but like turkey mashed potato stuffing gravy all that kind of stuff I'd love \nthat except I only like getting it once a year so \nDoes creatine really help? Does creatine really help \nI believe in terms of muscle building supplements outside of protein obviously it is probably the most studied \nsupplement that has proven to actually help so yes I believe it does how are \nHow are you so relaxed and chill? you so relaxed and chill a great \nquestion I'm not really sure I think \nsubconsciously I just learned that like kind of ratting the midline not being like two one way or the other kind of leads you to a more stable happy feeling life and I just naturally did I'm also \nvery lucky and grateful to have been raised in a very like loving and \nsupportive family \nand that has given me a lot of \nself-confidence and happiness in my life that not a lot of stress honestly the\nthis past few years of my life have been the most stress I've ever had in my life I'm still relaxed and chill but I I \nstill feel stress inside me and anxiety about certain things but I also really like really focus a lot on mindset and I talk about that a lot probably not enough but like I love reading about like stoic philosophy different mindsets books from like female therapists like bne brown that normally you would think think of body build listen to you different various subjects all talking about mindset and how you can kind of like get through difficult times and understanding to like take your emotions feel them understand them and try not to react to them and think through logic and like I don't know I'm trying to like put a bunch of thoughts into one thing right now but kind of just focusing on my mindset trying to look at things as they are not as I my emotions believe that they are and living like that my my therapist say one the or one of her big keys that she focus on is acceptance of just everything accept everything as it is don't make it worse than it is don't put your emotions into it don't put\nexaggerations onto it just be accepting be like don't be like oh I don't want to be a anxious person I don't want to be have a list I don't want to be nervous to talk to girls don't like think that you don't want anything cuz you're kind of shaming yourself and you're keeping it within you but said accept how you are how you feel about things be like I am this I still love myself for being this but I can grow I can be better I can change into this or look at the positive things of something that you might always see as negative and just find the best things learn to accept it and once you've accepted and you love yourself for all that you are then you can start to grow through things and in my opinion having that understanding in your mind it really makes you kind of relax and chill and it's usually when you're in denial of things of who you are or how you feel that you kind of build more stress anxiety and kind of can react more out of emotion as opposed to logic of the truth that's around \nyou I don't know if that really made sense but with that ramble I think I'm\ngoing to wrap this up it's getting late and I got to eat again so yeah if you guys like this type of video let me know I think it's kind of interesting trying to put my mindset into the questions you give you a little more in depth than I would on like an Instagram quick answer with a few words so if you got this far thank you guys for watching appreciate it and yeah maybe we'll do one of these again if you liked it but until then catch you in the next video"

    "text": "How to Build the Life You Want ? Transcript (Chris Bumstead) \nCompiled on October 28, 2025 \nI hope I'm not the only one who goes through phases where I absolutely suck at like hitting goals and being consistent essentially I realized that competing in the Olympia and being a bodybuilder I was going through so many phases where I would get super ramped up and prep be super consistent on a tight schedule a tight routine everything at the same time every day doing everything I needed and then I would kind of dip down right after the I would kind of fall off I'd go to the gym when I find the time but I didn't really have a routine so I would often skip days not feel great and I was giving myself a break and when I did that a lot of other things in my life were kind of falling off and then it would slowly ramp up in my offseason you know travel and business and work is kind of crazy and then it would get super dialed and locked in again for prep and I was just realizing that I was going through these phases and I was so efficient in prep and then very inefficient other times of the year so I wanted to take some of the habits and the mindsets and the things that I applied throughout prep that made me efficient and learn how to apply them to like my day-to-day life forever consistently so I kind of dove in for the last week or so just like reflecting and writing down some things that I did and my goal is to apply them to my life going forward forever and hopefully help you guys too so I'm not going to get into too deeply because I'll be sitting here for an hour and I wrote a [ __ ] lot of [ __ ] but I'm going to just tell you guys some things I put down and maybe it'll help you first thing is a clear goal obviously at the Olympia you know there's nothing more clear than a [ __ ] goal October 14th 2024 competing at the Olympia in Las Vegas like that's the goal I got to win the Olympia but this thing that always stuck with me super cheesy and I'm not going to get into deep cuz my mom was the one who taught it to me and you can find it online but it's called smart goals it stands for specific measurable achievable relatable and time base so specific you need a very specific goal not just like I want to be strong it's like how strong do you want to be at what date do you want to be strong what lifs do you want to be explosive strong do you want to be like powerlifter strong what are your specific goals measure obviously be able to measure it attainable has to be possible relatable has to be authentic to yourself something you care about time base there has to be a time base on it like I said I'm not going to get deep into that because you guys can Google that yourself but the big thing that I wanted to touch on here that I realized I applied into becoming Mr Olympian I think really helped me drive my success in my life was instead of having a goal necessarily like a thing that would end and then like the Olympia would fall off afterwards it was more of an identity a sense of self that I was trying to build and become someone who could complete X so the way I kind of worded it and I had written this down in one of the monologues they did before a prep Series without even realizing that was the way I think it's instead of I want to win the Olympia it's the goals you could write out to be more efficient I want to be someone who X so I want to be someone who trains consistently every single day hit sets to failure never Skips a meal never cheats on his diet gets his sleep and Recovery that he needs all the these different things like that and I thought that was so important and a huge thing for me within that was it wasn't just the actions and the physical things you did but your mentality the way you think\nthe way you treat people and all these things cuz you might think of the identity of the champion as someone who is a little bit you know edges on the side of arrogance super cocky confident and that's what winners do because a lot of people we see in the media are like that but that wasn't relatable or authentic to me so the self I wanted to betray before I was the champion was the humble respect full champion who treated everybody the same whether it was a former Mr Olympia backstage a stage Marshal a security guard whoever it might be the person the champion I wanted to be with someone who embodied that respect because I knew people would be looking up to me when I became this Champion not only for what I did but who I was and I wanted to be someone that my mom and their moms would be proud of if that's how they were acting so the next thing I kind of dove into here was you have an identity and then creating a list of things and defining very specifically what those people do and this comes back to that goal is I want to be someone who X so I want to be someone who you know what does Mr Olympia do and I you write that list down and you know you treat people with respect you're humble you go to the gym every single day whether it's to train or to do active recovering to stretch to hit ABS to hit your accessory body parts you know you never cheat on your diet and doing these things as much as possible the more you define these habits and you live these habits you will naturally become the success that you want to achieve so instead of chasing after that goal you become the identity and the person that will naturally attract that goal I think the biggest thing that people always come to me and ask me when I'm doing like meet and greets and they ask me it's always like how do I start what do I do how do I start I have all these things XY andz and you can watch a million YouTube videos read a million books and sometimes you get like overwhelmed by the amount of steps that are out there and and I mean nothing matters unless you actually do it so taking action is the most important hardest part you know I've always had this mindset that you are not what you think you're not who you think you are you just simply are what you repeatedly do so you can think positive things you can think this is huge in relationships you know like I could tell my my wife I think you're beautiful I think I love you I just don't say it well she's not going to know and feel it unless I show her with my actions and it's the same at anything in life so taking action is the most crucial point of everything and I think what people [ __ ] up is they get over overwhelmed with too many steps and things to do so this is going to be the most basic tip but the most important one if you take anything away from this build an identity and start [ __ ] small to build momentum those three things are everything when you break that down so for example when I used to be in college I used to drink three times a week get like blackout drunk go out with my friends and I loved it you know I love the social life I was in college hanging out with people was the only time my life had to be able to live like that and I was aware of that so I didn't want to sacrifice that so I did that for a period of time but then I wanted to take bodybuilding more seriously I was on the edge of going pro and I knew I had a lot of potential in me but I knew my lifestyle was holding me back but I also wasn't ready to sacrifice my social life yet so instead of just telling myself all right I'm going to stop drinking stop going out go to bed at 9:00 p.m. wake up at 6:00 a.m. do my cardio never miss a meal do all these things I was like I'm eating pretty good still cheating a lot cuz I like going out my friends and I love going out at night but I'm going to stop drinking so I still stayed out until 2 a.m. every night but I made one small change and that would to stop drinking and just that alone waking up not hung over and not wanting to eat bacon and [ __ ] God knows what else for breakfast CU you're hung over and tired and lazy having a bad workout horrible recovery from the alcohol throwing up your system I was able to make a decent amount of progress from that alone and the momentum I built from that one small change encouraged me to want to make more changes and eventually I stopped going out completely started\nto go to bed early I started to clean up my diet and I started to make all these little changes that eventually that literal year was the year that I turned Pro won two pro shows and made it to the Olympia just from making these subtle changes and it was huge and the one change I made made this Cascade effect into everything in my life and I think starting small in order to build momentum and being conscious that you were starting small intentionally to build momentum is huge so the goal when you're starting something especially if you're fresh the goal is to be consistent not perfect so create an identity Define what that person does start small and make your goal to pick something that you can be consistent with where imp perfect I don't need you achieve the whole list pick one start with that and with that momentum start another one and another one and another one and after a while once you're embodying these habits these actions and these behaviors without even thinking of your goal anymore you're going to achieve your goal as long as you're doing this like well thought out and the idea with momentum is I mean as anything if you're driving a car and you take your foot off the brake and you roll into a wall you're going to just [ __ ] tap into the wall [ __ ] up your car a little bit if you're driving 150 miles per hour at a brick wall and just [ __ ] fly right through that thing probably keep going there through at the other side you might you know get a little scratches on your car but you're still moving it doesn't stop you because you have so much momentum and that's the same thing with this after starting making those small changes when I was young and building these habits over time I didn't even feel like it was like I was dieting I didn't feel like I was eating healthy I didn't feel like I was training hard it was just life it who I was and it was what I did so when something came in the way whether I was in prep and it was my lat tear my hamstring tear 2018 when I was in the hospital you know last year I had a minor hamstring tear I didn't even really talk about it became the thing where I didn't even have a chance to hold me back because I had so much momentum had such an identity attached to behaviors that I did that when something came in to stop me I just kept rolling forward through it after so a lat tear would be something that would hold me back for a little bit and I'd be immediately back on my [ __ ] moving forward getting better and better and I can't stress that enough that momentum is like the secret to get through stuff cuz when things are so habitual that you don't have to think about them that when chaos hits in your life whether it be personal stressful mental emotional physical your habits you don't have to think about they take less energy so you just keep moving forward you keep getting better better and it's [ __ ] everything all right so the next little tip amongst all these all are kind of the actionable steps but the other thing that I realized I did without knowing it is selft talk and like personal accountability I tie these in together because how you talk to yourself is sometimes how you hold yourself accountable but personal accountability means you're responsible for your own life which means you are Empower you have the power to control and change your life so personal accountability equals power power is the ability to do whatever the [ __ ] you want in your life so no one else wants you to [ __ ] hit your goals like you do no one cares what you do Beyond yourself so make sure you're holding yourself accountable you're not waiting for someone else to encourage you you're waiting for someone else to go to the gym do this or that you really have to hold yourself accountable you know it's in the selft talk piece a little thing that I this is how I label it now but I wasn't intentionally doing it in purpose in the time but I was always talk to myself in my head like I was a mentor talking to my Apprentice you know there's always like your thoughts in your mind and then there's the thinker of the thoughts you know there's two kind of when you're talking to yourself in your head there's someone talking and then there's someone paying attention so there's kind of two like dualistic identities inside your brain at any given time and I viewed it as like a mentor who is the retired six-time Mr Olympia talking to the amateur The Apprentice who\nwanted to become that and was embodying that and working towards that so when I would talk to myself like come on champ come on you want to be Mr Olympia like let's get after it it was like my future Mr Olympia self talking to myself and when I would be on a treadmill I'd be supposed to do 30 minutes 25 minutes goes by I'm like add bored tired want to go eat breakfast deep in prep whatever and I get off I'd get off and talk to myself like come on champ like is that what Mr Olympia does is Mr Olympia to get out five minutes before his cardio's done I'm like [ __ ] and I drag myself back on finish my cardio and actually do it right same thing with you know a set if I'm aiming for 10 I get eight and I just put the weights down and I'm like what the [ __ ] like you could have gotten 10 maybe I Take 5 minutes do another set that I'm not even supposed to do to hit that 10 just to hold myself accountable or I get right back on and do two more three more reps just to make sure I'm hitting that 10 that I was supposed to but holding yourself accountable and having the proper self talk is important and I don't think this comes from shame I don't think shaming yourself calling yourself a piece of [ __ ] like you fat [ __ ] get after it all these things I don't personally believe that works at all I think if you call yourself a fat [ __ ] and you begin to identify as a fat [ __ ] you will continue to act like a fat [ __ ] so not to use fat shaming as an example at all but that's a huge one that people do you know that eat bad [ __ ] I'm so fat I'm so fat I'm going to keep eating bad like no it's don't shame yourself positive reinforcement talk to yourself from like a oneup position in a positive form hold yourself accountable to be better not to shame yourself for being worse I think that's absolutely huge positivity is [ __ ] massive and I think so many people think driving forward from shame works because it does for a period of time but if you're trying to be a six-time Mr Olympia or do something consistently I truly believe that everything I just listed of building identity a habits a self-accountability the positive selft talk those are the only ways to properly sustain things obviously within that you know the goal of everything I'm talking about I'm trying to focus more on like mental things and the mental side of things and even in the behavior something I didn't mention if I was like Mr Olympia is someone who always has their head on right what does someone who has their head on right do you know they self-reflect they Journal they go to therapy they talk about their emotions and their feelings they let things out they don't hold it all in and these were all part of the identity that I began to build to be create a mind set that could do anything rather than just trying to accomplish one thing and I think that was the most important thing that I kind of naturally built over time and I didn't even realize what I was doing I was just again starting small and building habits creating identity around something I wanted to be knowing I wanted to be Mr Olympia and embodying that next thing I knew I was [ __ ] looking back retiring and I had done it six times and I was like wow like you did it and it was pretty cool so you know there's a lot of these things that I'm going to try to apply to absolutely everything in my life such as you know being a good father defining what that means to me being someone who you know is present when his kids around is emotionally there for his daughter is you know drives them to their games leaves work early because priority is family these little things that are important to me something that I want to Define so I know who I want to be and I'm aware of it and then I can actually act and live it out so yeah that's pretty much it but essentially clear outcome clear goal Google smart goals I don't need to do that consistent identity Define what that identity is start small build momentum and just [ __ ] create an identity be someone who X and Define that very specifically not I want to be jacked I want to be someone who and what are the attributes that you would view as someone who is jacked use that as an example obviously because it's easy for me to use selft talk being positive personal accountability it all comes down to yourself you know I don't even repeat myself it is what it is but yeah this is something that I've been personally reflecting on and I just wanted to share that with you guys I think you know there's a\nlot of lessons that I learned that I didn't even understand I was learning and you know there's two times to learn from something it's from the experience and then from reflecting on the experience and I think from reflecting on the experience is when you truly are able to learn and make changes to your life going forward because the greatest achievement of accomplishing your goals isn't the goal it's who you become and accomplishing those goals so I want to do my best to be able to share a lot of the things I did hopefully help you guys move forward and as I doing my self-reflection on the experience I just lived I'm going to try and kind of share these little tidbits if you will with you guys so sorry for the rant hope that made sense I tried to I literally have like five bullet points on my phone that I'm going off from a 10 minute video however long I'm talking so hopefully it made sense but appreciate you guys thanks for watching"

Chris Bumstead \nVerbatim transcript (provided by user) \nthis is going out the day after the Olympia what do you hope happened \nyesterday well I certainly hope I won definitely easiest answer to give this \nyear is just very important to me to really want to bring my best package you know it sounds cheesy to say but I've \nbeen working hard going through a lot of adversities and challenges over the years and every Year's had something \nkind of like get in my way and felt like it would holding me back this year's had a few earlier on in the year but at this \npoint point I'm feeling pretty good feeling pretty set so just want to be able to stride into this one I want to be able to enjoy it I want to be able to \nyou know get off stage kiss my wife hold my baby know that I became the best in \nthe world and maintained a beautiful relationship through it how important is it to share the success with somebody \nelse as opposed to just doing it for yourself it's hard to say how important \nit is because I haven't had the success without her but I can't imagine it in any other way I think you know in the meaning we find in life it's beautiful to do hard things and to accomplish things but if you were to do it alone it's just not the same as being \nable to share with someone I think there's a level of you know codependence and regulation that can be healthy and \ncan help you push through be more present not have to shut off and numb so much you know I think a lot of people \nwho going through hard things trying to accomplish really big levels of success numb a lot to get there and I think being able to have a partner in which you can regulate yourself with and share and communicate and lean on prevents you \nfrom having to numb brings you closer together which is its own experience as well as the experience of whatever you're working toward so it's like double the amount of joy that you get to feel growing in two ways at once exactly yeah and who doesn't want a big hug after you accomplish something you know yeah that's cool what will you be talking about in your speech hopefully in my speech hopefully it's a good \nquestion I would say just talking about this year I've been thinking a lot about \nthe sacrifices that come with success you know like nothing comes for free and \nI've reflected a lot over the years of how much of my mental peace I've had to sacrifice to accomplish what I've accomplished and it's just been a lot of like waking up at 5:00 a.m. going through the day wake up weigh myself weigh my food do my check-ins in the mirror like go to the gym work out how WR everything is like am I good enough \nam I being enough am I doing enough to win the Olympia right now it's all just compared to being Mr Olympia to that \nlevel of success and you know people talk about what you sacrifice to be great at things and they normally like you don't get to go hang out with your \nfriends you don't get to go party go go do these things but I think for me the biggest sacrifice has just been the my me my mental Peace So the goal this year has been trying to find that maintain it have the mental peace while also \nthriving at a high level and seeing how I can do that as as efficiently as possible and you know I'd like to be able to say I did so successfully talk to me about the the tension of being as \nhigh of a performer the best in the world of what you do whilst also so not having that neurotic drive that sort of ambient anxiety that you can never switch off because it seems like that \nanxiety is precisely what creates the perfectionism approach that allows you\nPage 1 \nDiscipline & Mindset Interview ? Chris Bumstead (Transcript) 2025-10-27 \nto cover all of those bases is it possible to have one without the other I'm not sure I still have a level of neuroticism in me even though I've been succeeding for like five six years now and it's definitely gotten better you know I I don't focus on perfection I focus on just being doing the best I can but even within that I have that voice \nin my head that will look at myself every now and then be like it's not that I'm a shitty person but if I'm trying to be Mr lumpy like you're not doing enough and it creates a like a impeding anxiety upon myself like I'm not doing enough and that's not like an overwhelming thing all the time it's it's a drive for me to keep being better and keep pushing more and more but it's a lot so I think being able to manage that is one of the most challenging things of maintaining success for an extended period of time you know there's two different mindsets when you win something there's oh I won I did it I'm \ndone and then there's oh like I better I got to do better than this one \nnow I have to maintain this not only maintain this but this is the bare minimum of what's expected of me and I got to do better now so there's the \nbalance of all that and I think over the last couple years I've been able to really be able to fix my perspective on just being grateful for the privilege of it you know there's been times where I thought I was going to stop competing \nbecause the pressure felt so high and then when I started to step away from it I was like I would really miss this pressure like there something I love about it there something I love about being put back against the corner like knowing that there's a lot of work I have to do feeling like I can't accomplish my goal and you're going to have to do it there's something so like \nsimple and beautiful in the meaning of just doing something that difficult under that level of pressure that you're choosing to do you know people say you \nfind meaning in suffering and I think if you put yourself into like a meaningless suffering it's kind of just it's dumb there's no point you're just hurting yourself for no reason but if you can find your meaning in Just Doing Hard that are as close as possible to \nsuffering that you're still benefiting from and you still enjoy I think it's beautiful that's one of the vicious double-edged swords of having success if you have that kind of mentality which I know all all too well that anytime you \nreach a new high or achieve some new kind of bar MH hooray we did it \nimmediately the next thought after that is oh I now need to do it again but better that's now the next minute mhm yeah and I've I've had conversations with many people about the possibility of not having that and just being able \nto enjoy and relieve the pressure on yourself and you know there's all these studies that come out talk about motivation and drive saying that you can get more from coming from like a secure place rather than beating yourself up \nand it's like it depends on what your version of success is like can these people correct live a life to be more happy and fulfilled yes but will they be Michael Jordan have six championships dude I probably not you know I love this \ntopic I love it so much and uh I think the bottom line is that if you're \ntalking about beating everybody else on the planet to a thing what you're actually talking about is what are you prepared to sacrifice psychologically physically existentially relationally \nsocially in terms of your self-esteem your confident everything right all of that because if you're if there's even a part of you that's thinking well I'm going to do this I'm going to balance it because I want to feel satisfied I want feel comfortable with myself and so on \nand so forth that's fine for as long as it contributes to your performance within the domain that you're competing in but as soon as you sacrifice any \noutput in that that's just an opening for somebody else that's the competitor that's going to come in and get it because I use this example of Eddie Hall World's Strongest Man uh 2017 or 18 I \nthink and he's there you know he's worked hard toward this final goal he wins it once and he's crying and he's\nPage 2 \nDiscipline & Mindset Interview ?

    "text": "Cutting ? Video Transcript \nSource: User-provided transcript \nPrepared on 2025-10-26 \nNotes \nThis is a cleaned, formatted transcript based on your text. Short, title-like lines were treated as section headers (e.g., ?How Do I Start a Cut??).\nIntro \n[Music] What is up, YouTube? I was going to do a full day of eating today, which will come soon, but I remembered when I did that ultimate guide to bulking, a lot of people requested the ultimate guide to cutting. So, I'm going to be doing that instead. Still making a meal right now, eating clean, but I'm going to be running you guys through just some tips and tricks that I learned on the long along the way of my bodybuilding career on how to get shredded. It's also because I'm kind of going into like a mini cut of myself, at least trying to lean up while maintain muscle, not a hard tread. But I'll be talking about what I do, but mainly about a lot of questions that I get about it. Similar \nHow Do I Know When to Cut? \nto the bulking one, it started off with how do I know when to cut and how long do I cut for? And again, it's very dependent on what your goals are. But in my opinion, when you start to lose your abs, for me especially, cuz my abs are something that are gone pretty late. So when I have a lot of body fat, I'll lose them. But if you have no ab showing anymore, you might be at the point of a bulk where you're starting to lose and plateau and you need to cut down, you know, fix your insulin sensitivity, your metabolism, your digestion, a lot of things that are better off in a cut. So, when you get to that point where you don't really like how your body looks, you're kind of fatter than you want to be, or you just want to be leaner cuz it's personal preference, then you can start a cut. And cuts can really go as long as you want, depending on how you do it. If it's like a really punch in the face shred and you're like 2% body fat, that's aggressive. sub 10% body fat over an extended period of time, it will start to affect your hormones. So, you don't really want to do that for longer than like, you know, probably 3 to four months. But if you're just like getting shredded, coming back up a little bit, having reheats, consistently fueling your body, and you're continuously making progress in the gym, you can keep going constantly. As long as your body feels good, your body's optimized, energy is good, still making progress, you can keep pushing and going, going. So, don't stress about going too long, unless you're like sacrificing in the gym and you're starting to lose all your gains. \nHow Do I Start a Cut? \nAll right, so the next big thing is how do you start a cut? And in my opinion, there's a lot of ways to do it, but there's two main ways to do it, and it depends on your lifestyle, so I'll go over both. The best way to do it, in my opinion, is you're already eating relatively consistently. Even if you're not tracking, but you think you eat the same thing every day. Log every single thing that you eat for at least a week. 2 weeks is even better. But if you log everything you put in your mouth like condiments, juices, drinks on top of all your food, vegetables, everything, count the calories every single day and track your weight and night and do that for an extended period of time. Most people naturally get to a baseline where they're eating about the same and they're staying about the same weight when they're not trying. And that's your baseline calories. So from there, you need to adjust up or down on where to start. The other way is if you're super inconsistent, you have no idea what you're eating. Sometimes you're up, sometimes you're down, and you don't know where you're going. You can start with a macro calculator. Enter in all your all your information. It will tell you where to start. Give you a rough estimate. But still start with that. Follow it every single day for a couple weeks and track consistently and see what your weight does. If you're gaining too fast or losing too fast or whatever it may be, then you really want to adjust that from the point of picking\nBalancing Macros \nout your macros. Cuz this is personally how I like to diet. I would pick macros and then create a diet plan off that and then stick to that strict diet plan. Macros are super basic. Everyone know this. It's going to be 1 to 1.5 grams per pound of lean body mass of protein that you want to hit. So if I'm 260 pounds in my offseason, but my lean body mass is 240, then I want to be a minimum of 240 g of protein. But I almost always pump that up to like 350 because there's a lot of studies that have shown that if you're hitting up to 100 grams of protein per meal multiple times in a day, you can still use that and increase protein density more and more and more and keep making more gains. And especially in a cut when you're trying to preserve muscle as much as possible, having enough protein is extremely crucial. Even your body's ability to metabolize protein requires more energy and it's less likely to turn protein into fat than it is carbs into fat. Some more protein is a great thing on a cut. Don't be scared of it. Start with that. And then from there, picking your carbs and fats. It's dependent on the individual. I like to do 7030 splits to start. So, I do 70% carbs, 30% fat. And because I have a higher ratio of carbs, as I'm dieting, I'm kind of pulling from that. But it's super simple. You start with that. You find what your baseline is by tracking over an extended period of time. Log your food, log your weight, see what you're at. Biggest tip. Um, I could probably leave 90% of the world. Yeah, they're probably not 90% of the world cuz if you're watching my YouTube channel, you probably care about your fitness. You're more into it. But the average person can just track their weight, write down what they're putting. And that psychological conscious awareness of what they're eating would change their habits of what they're eating. They're like, \"Holy [beep] I'm eating 100 g of sugar from this coke and this [beep] and all that [beep] I'm just I don't want to write that down. I'm not going to eat it.\" And it will make you better. And even myself at the level that I am, that still makes me better to an extent. But when we want to be elite and make gains, you have to go beyond that. So track everything consistently going forward. And once you have that, you have your baseline calories. So your weight's not changing. You have enough protein so that you can recover, make gains, keep your muscle, and you're at a consistent thing. I like to drop two to 300 calories to start and add in a little bit of cardio, not cardio to the point where you're going crazy or not. And I'll get into cardio a little bit later, but the key thing is just drop 200 calories. Personally, I start purely from carbs. So, I have my baseline 1.5 g per pound of body weight of protein, 70% carbs for the rest of my macros, 30% fat, and then I take 200 calories of carbs, and I pull that out of my diet. And then that's how I start, and I know I'm good to go. [Music] Creating a Diet Plan All right, so next thing is that there's two ways, again, two optimal ways, in my opinion, is more to it of creating a diet. There's if it fits your macros. But if it's fit your macros, whole foods, which I recommend way more than if it fits your macros, shitty food. Get into that, too. And then there's just a meal plan. I personally like having a meal plan cuz it just takes the guesswork out of everything. The more you have to consciously think and you get decision fatigue and you go overinking, you're more likely to make bad decisions because naturally we go to the easy decision and we're constantly over and overthink. We're going to pick the easy thing, which is usually better food, more access or something. So, in my mind, having the same thing I'm eating every single day, it just doesn't even have an option to cheat on my meal to cheat on my meal plan. So, I literally write it out and I print it cuz I'm [beep] old like that. If I had a fridge that had a magnet on it, I would put it right on there. But, I write this out. Meal 1 2 3 4 5 plus a shake. And I write it out and I eat the same thing every single day. And then from there, it's easy to break. And if I want on a day, it's like, okay, my breakfast is two eggs, one scoop of isolate, 40 g of oats. I'm rushing out the door. I know 40 g of oats is 27 g of carbs. I have two pieces of toast that are each 15 grams of carbs. I'll survive that day, you know, but typically trying to hit that. The other style, obviously, if it fits your macros, the idea of that one is that you have, my opinion, it\nmeans you have a lot more time on your hands and you're a person who craves foods really heavily. So, the idea is understanding what's going to work best for you. Whatever plan that you can adhere to most consistently will be the best route. Not necessarily saying a diet plan or macros are the better way to do it, but if you're going to do one more consistently, then it's much better. But when it comes to the macros, like I said, whole foods are so much more important. Again, if I were to talk to the average population, I'd be like, track your food, eat whole foods. Just start with fat and most people will be so much healthier and in much better shape. And it's a lot harder to over consume in healthy foods. Like eating ultrarocessed foods, you're just more likely to condense calories in. And on top of that, there's a bigger cascade effect. I'm not a big believer in the whole calories in calories out being everything because there's a hormonal effect that you have of putting foods in your body. There's higher inflammation, higher cortisol, eating at certain times a day, eating shitty foods. It can affect your sleep when you sleep soft. Again, higher cortisol. Higher cortisol mean it's hard harder for your body to burn fat. So, you're not going to get lean as fast. And it could have all these other effects on top of affecting your energy while you train your ability to recover. And obviously, more muscle you have, the more fat you can burn, the more muscle you want to have, more shredded you look. There's so many effects to it. So, I don't even want to talk about if it fits your macro shitty food. I don't recommend at all. Clean bulks, clean cuts, all the way. Healthy food is the way to go. We're taking care of our bodies. Just eat healthy. But if you have the time to go through every single meal and be like, \"Okay, I'm going to have 50 g of protein, 10 g of fat, 30 g of carbs. I can eat whatever I want in the realm of potato, rice, chicken, salmon, almond butter, all the different arrays of healthy whole foods, then good for you. But I don't have [beep] time for that [beep] So, I eat the same thing every single day, and I know what I got to do. And if dinner is something my family's making, then I can weigh it out and figure it out from there. [Music] \nCheat Meals \nAll right, so on the topic of kind of shitty foods like and if it fits your macros, people love to ask about cheat meals. And in my opinion, it depends on the person. If you're trying to drive results is your biggest goal and that's all you care about, then no, you shouldn't be having cheat meals. A cheat meal of shitty food is strictly for the mental reprieve that you need it. So, if you eat [beep] a burger on Sunday and you can continuously lose weight doing that and mentally you feel better and it drives you through the week excited for that, then fine. We all have our reasons to push forward and continue. But if you're optimally trying to progress, then no, cheat meals are not good. I really never had cheat meals throughout my preps unless I like needed to hammer in like a burger and fries cuz I couldn't get enough calories in. 99% of the time it was a refeed day. out with exactly the same foods I'm eating consistently, but instead of 100 g of rice in a meal, it would be like 300 g of rice and an avocado. So, getting that clean food and doing it and just kind of giving my metabolism a kick in the ass, driving the workout the next day. And \nTraining & Nutrient Timing \nagain, I spoke about this a lot in prep, but those would be typically pushed right before a leg day. So, if I had like a heavy workout chest day, the next day was leg day, I'd have the cheat meal that night to recover from that chest day and then drive those carbs into the leg day the next day. So, I'm getting recovery and performance from the benefit. Super important. So, metabolism \nRamping Your Metabolism\nis obviously a big talk when it comes to dieting. And there's like the idea of ramping up your metabolism and also the idea of it slowing down over time. And there's also a lot of debate of whether or not this is true and what causes it. But from my personal experience, which contradicts some studies, but it's worked for me, so I don't really care. If I can ramp up my metabolism before I'm dieting for eating more meals in a day and more food in a day consistently and utilize that food by training maybe a little bit of cardio in my offseason, then when I started prep eating more calories, I'm in a much better position. I've started preps eating 6,000 calories a day and my diet just like coasts through. And I've started preps at like 3,000 calories a day where I need to almost ramp up a bit and then back down and they're much harder. But I've always noticed that throughout my offseason, I get a little bit lazy and I'll eat three meals a day and I'll start to feel sluggish, harder to eat, all these things. And if I cut those meals into smaller meals and I spread them out throughout the day, I'm eating the same amount of food and also my energy will get better, my digestion will get better. I'll start to get leaner while eating the same amount of food. So, I can up my calories. I'm able to obviously consume more energy. Therefore, I'll recover better, train better, and make more gains. And there's a lot of people, everyone scientifically believes that you can't boost your metabolism by eating more frequent meals and spreading them out. So, I don't know, but for me, it has worked every single time. And I've done it in a vacuum. Not many people have been like, I eat the same thing, taking the same supplements that did not change, the same thing consistently, the same cardio, waking up at the same time, eating the same thing. All I did was divide from five to six meals, and I got a little bit leaner from there. And then I went from six to seven meals at the end of my Olympia prep, and it was super helpful for me. So stuff like intermittent fasting can help because it's easy to just not eat and then cram food at the end of the day. But in my opinion, you're going to blunt your metabolism over time to do that and plateau a lot quicker. So not something I recommend. All right, so another \nHow Fast Should I Lose Weight? \nquestion consistently get is how fast should you lose weight and how do you know if you're losing it too fast? And in my opinion, the big best way to avoid that is not by throwing too many tools in at once. So, like I said at the beginning, by just starting with a little bit of cardio and then taking down \n200 calories from your baseline, you're not just going to plummet from doing something such a small change. But if you're like, I'm going to do an hour cardio. I'm going to cut 1,000 calories. I'm going to start doing X, Y, and Z. I'm going to walk every do all these different things and your body starts dropping too fast, then you're much likely to plateau. So, if you're trying to do a long cut, let your body have the tools over time. Start with small things at a time. But on average, I would say if you're losing more than like three pounds a month, you're close to that point. Through my Olympia preps, I would lose I would start relatively lean, but to get like peeled, I would lose 25 lbs over 14 weeks. So that's less than 2 lbs a week on average. But typically, I'd get down to like 250 lbs and then be like 4 weeks out still and I would lose 10 lbs in the last 4 weeks. So there's a way that you can do it up and down. But another big thing on that is if you start hitting plateaus too early when their standard plus group, this is the biggest thing that I've learned from talking to all these people will be like, \"Hey, I'm plateaued. I can't lose any more weight. I'm 220 lb eating a 1,400 calories doing this.\" And I'm like, \"Wa, that's like a low amount of calories for that weight to not be losing any weight.\" So, your body probably starts it needs to ramp up a little bit. And if you're trying to get lean and that's all you care about, let's say you're prep in a transformation challenge or whatever it may be, in my opinion, the best thing that you can do is start carb cycling. And this is like an elite level of dieting. Cutting your calories is one thing, but being able to carb cycle is super effective. So, if you can start having those refeed days, like I said, a high carb day before a heavy workout.\nYou're kind of boosting your body's metabolism. You're letting it know you're going to be giving it fuel. You're going to be giving it something that it needs so it can like work extra hard on those days. train hard, get the system running, and then the next day when you cut back down to low calories, it will like fall through that cell. And it just gives your body the signal that you're not in starvation mode all the time cuz your body's constantly starving. It's just preserving energy and trying to hold on to the best possible. So that's one of the best ways to do it. The other way would just to be pull off your diet for a little bit, up your calories by like 200. So the reverse of how you started, and start ramping up a little bit rather than down, and let your body get used to properly be properly recovering and all these things. There's so many other factors that come into that that I could ramble on forever, but the biggest one I would say is sleep. If you're high cortisol and your sleep is [beep] and you're trying to diet, it's going to stop you from doing it. So sometimes dieting too hard makes you lose sleep. So you need that little bit of recmp where you're eating a little bit more. Maybe you're taking a little bit off training. You're recovering. Your nervous system is recovering. You're sleeping better. You're dropping your cortisol for an extended period of time. And then you hop back in your diet and you'll continue to progress. So don't stress about it. If you're like, I'm eating 1400 calories and I'm not losing weight. I need to go down 1,000 calories. Maybe your body needs a break. But really, really listen to yourself and you have to be tracking consistently to actually know these things. All right, so meals sometimes suck in \nBest Condiments \ndieting. And the topline answer is it is what it is. You're trying to get shredded. Take it. But for people who are just dieting for life or even myself sometimes being able to just optimize condiments to make food taste a little bit better, the three top condiments that I used throughout my preps were honey mustard, Sriracha, and coconut aminos. Cocon probably had the most sugar. I specifically got the whole foods honey mustard because it was the lowest amount of sugar, lowest amount of calories. And in Sriracha, you have to be careful for some of them. They have sugar in them, but those are super low calorie and good to go. But the goal with condiments is if you start your prep with them, keep them in until you have to cut them out. But if you don't have any condiments in and then you add them in later, you're technically adding more calories. So the goal is like if you start consistently with something and you're adjusting changes with everything every other variable being the same variable being the same, then you're good to go to continue to make progress. But you don't want to add in something like honey mustard when you're 2 weeks out the Olympia cuz you're adding in a significant amount of calories relative to what you're eating to not affect it. But food does some suck sometimes. So finding the right amount of condiments to add stuff can be beneficial. But weigh it at least a couple times because you'll be shocked by how much you do it. People who use almond butter are like, \"Yeah, a teaspoon of it.\" They're putting like four tablespoons on it. Or this says five calories per teaspoon. A teaspoon is like absolutely nothing. I would probably put at least four teaspoons minimum on a meal. So, it's 20 calories. So, just be conscious of that. Don't be dumb. What isn't measured, isn't managed. Continue to track your stuff so you actually know what's going in your body and understand why you are or not getting results. Best Supplements for Cutting All right. So, people love to ask about supplements for especially for cutting, putting on muscle or cutting. Cutting, I feel like people just lean into supplements. I never really was big on taking specific supplements that led to fat loss. But in terms of supplements that can help on a cut, first off, I would start with things that are just important in keeping your systems running, whether it be hormone production, energy production, all the different things. So, something like a multivitamin, especially when you're dieting really hard. Hopefully, you're getting your veggies in and all the stuff, but food also\nsucks nowadays. But when you're limiting your food, maybe you're not getting enough nutrients. So something like a multivitamin is super helpful. Beyond that, satiating the body is super important. Protein is huge. So I always have a protein powder in it. It's probably the leanest, easily, easiest digestible, lowest calorie way to get in any amount of protein. The protein shake. Also, in terms of like diet hacks, if you're ever going out to like dinner with people and you're trying to maybe just get a steak and eat food or not eat at all or going out for a long drive or whatever it may be, if you bring a protein shake with you, chug it right before going to dinner, it like kills cravings, kills your hunger super fast when it's only like 140 calories. So, super beneficial to utilize something like that. Amino acids also something really big just in terms of not losing muscle over extended periods of time. Being able to sip on it between meals and spike protein thin more and more time throughout the day to keep yourself progressing I think is super big. On top of that, I would say keeping inflammation low is always important. Same thing as cortisol management, hormone management, just keeping your systems operating. So something like an omega-3, super simple and easy to add in. And then I would say mental things for myself, especially when I'm down to like really dying. You start to be tired and dragging ass and you start to like not be able to remember a lot of things. stuff like alpha GPC, Cognizen, Tyroin to help that dopamine precursor to just keep your body to keep your mind focused and locked in, be able to know what you're doing, especially before the gym, like pre-workouts that have a good amount of caffeine and neutropics in it so that you can focus and get the job done and not just be like tired and lazy and hanging around. Super important. So, in my opinion, I wasn't a big guy taking any fat burners or anything like if I take this, I'll get shredded without doing anything. It was more so optimizing my systems and curbing my hunger, keeping protein sensitive high. I can still not say that word. It'll never come to me. But that was how I viewed supplements in a cut for myself. So give it a shot. Cardio also a huge \nCardio \nquestion people continuously ask about. Similar to what I was talking about not using tools too early, cardio is all about minimum effective dose. So having as minimal as possible when you're trying to maintain as much muscle as possible. And my cardio has changed now that I'm not competing anymore. and I actually care about my cardiovascular health and I want to be able to hit that so it's adjusted. But when I was in prep and I was just trying to get shredded, it was just incline walk on a treadmill. The lowest stress on my body which are where I was burning calories. I was trying to get my heart rate still to like 120 beats per minute. And then the \ndebate is always do you do it at night? \nDo you do the morning fasted? How do you want to do it? And in truth, it really doesn't matter as long as you're getting it done. The only thing is you don't want to do it before a workout because you don't want to take away your energy and nutrients away from driving into putting on muscle because it's still obviously the most important thing. So, I used to like doing it first thing in the morning and then I would eat a couple meals and train later in the day and that was the best way to implement it into my life. Now that I'm retired and life is different, I train after a meal one. So, I don't do cardio in the morning and I'll typically do cardio post-workout. So instead of doing before, which ruins your workout, I get the workout in. Maybe I'll get some aminos and then I'll do some cardio at my gym or or if I'm not at work all day that day, I'll come home and I bought two pieces of cardio that are a little bit more fun than just walking on a treadmill. So, I have a rower that I've been doing for hit training and then I have a bike which I can bike around my neighborhood and sometimes I combine both of them just to get more interest more interesting and I'll do them later\nin the day, do them in the sunlight, get outside, do some things and it kind of gets more active and gets me outside doing things rather than just chilling. I will also say that there's some people who train bodybuilders who get shredded and win shows who don't do any cardio. They just tell them to increase their steps. Start at like 5k steps, 7k steps, go to 10k steps, and just walk more in a day and track that. And those people get shredded, too, and it's possible. Some people get shredded without cardio. It really just depends on your body. So, the goal is if you're not losing weight and you brought your calories down a little bit, then add a little bit of cardio. I would start with 20 minutes five times a week, and just get your body moving, consistently burning a little bit more calories. The more output you have, the more input you can have, the more you can eat, and it's just a better system for your body to run. So, try different things that work best for you. You can do hit cardio, low intensity, steady state cardio, whatever you want to do. But if you're a bodybuilder, an optimalist muscle training, shredded, nothing else, low intensity, steady state is the way to go. Now that I want to have better heart health, better HRV, be in better shape. I've been doing a little bit more hit cardio at times, more biking, more this, more that, and it's super helpful. All Training on a Cut right, so training on a cut. You could get a lot deeper into this, but I'm giving you guys the [beep] top line right now. most important thing that you need. But in my mind, the goal is to not have to change your training until you have to. A lot of people are like, \"Oh, I'm cutting. I'm going to be tired. Let me drop the weight and then do more volume.\" And they do that before they're actually tired. But you don't want to preemptively do that. You want to wait till you're actually to the point where you can't lift a certain weight cuz you're so exhausted that it has to pull down. But if you can keep pushing forward and keep training hard and training intense through a cut and not changing anything, you're going to be better off. You're going to maintain more muscle or even put on muscle throughout that cut. So, I never really had different programs that were like, \"Hey, I'm going to do sets of 20 now that I'm dieting because it burns more calories.\" Because it really the amount of car calories extra that it burns is like negligent and you're just sacrificing gains by not lifting the way that's optimal to maintain and build muscle. So, don't really do it. How do you train like that? You really just don't be a [beep] The longer that you can actually push yourself and just mentally train hard, you're going to be better off for it. So, the thing that you can do in a cut around training that helps it is just nutrient timing. When you're down to really low calories and low carbs, the best way training wise is to put your carbs like moderate before, high after. It's not high, but if you have 50 g of carbs in a day, which is super low, I would do 20 g pre, 30 g post, and split it up like that so that you're getting it around your training, which is the most important time of the day for your body to be able to recover and utilize that as you need it. And that's really the biggest thing that I change around cutting other than just spreading out the carbs throughout the day. The only time that would change is if your sleep is really bad and you're starving in the middle of the night and you can't sleep. You can test this everything at the test in a sample to see what works best for your body by putting some carbs right before bed and seeing if that doesn't create a blood sugar drop, a cortisol spike in the middle of the night, which will ruin your sleep and then again will affect your cortisol, your gains, your fat loss, everything else. But beyond that, keep training hard. Don't change your program unless you have to put carbs around the workout. You're good to go. All right. So, I'll just go through a bunch of like tips and tricks now because a big question is like how do I How to Fight Cravings fight cravings? Essentially, again, topline answer is if you want high results, expect high discomfort. That's just the way it was. The more you suffer, the more you endure, the more results that you'll see. So, that's part of life and it's inevitable. But on top of that, if you're like constantly hungry, having hungry, having crazy cravings, one thing it may be is cortisol. High cortisol leads to a craving for ultrarocessed food, sugar, dense calories, whatever it may be, it makes you want food more. So things like screen exposure, being on your phone too much, having a stressful life situation, poor sleep, all these different things first of all affect each\nother, which then also affects the cascade of your hormones that make you more hungry and constantly wanting things. So just be conscious of that. All right. So huge Create a System for Success thing. I talk about this a lot. Having a structure, having system, setting yourself for up for success. A taking the guesswork out of it. So when you have a conscious brain, when you want the goal and you have good drive, you create a plan and then when your brain is feeling weak and falling off, you just follow the plan and it makes it easier for you. But setting yourself up with something like a system going throughout your day. Let's say I tell you it's perfect to eat your carbs before and after a workout, but in your mind, you train right in the middle of the day, and then when you come home at night, you have these crazy cravings. Well, then maybe it's better for you to drive results for you to have lower carb throughout the day while you're at work, driving the kids to school, doing things, busy, not thinking about it. You keep your calories low as possible, carbs low at that point. And then when you're home at night and you're chilling, you're bored, you're hanging out doing nothing, your cravings start to come. Well, at least you have carbs for that. So, it's kind of called carb backloading than putting it at the end of the day. And just that's more playing a mental game than it is a physical game, which is totally fine. If it drives results, it works. These things are all very nuanced and they're like fractional benefits. Eat at the right time and do all the things. When you stack these things, they work out a lot. But if you can't follow it because it's too hard, there's no point. So set yourself up for success. Create a system, a structure, a schedule that you cannot break. Another big thing that \nSeek Accountability \ncould help is having any level of accountability. Top line of this would be having a coach, having someone who's checking in on you, holding you accountable, helping you create structure, and just checking in on you essentially so you know you have accountability somewhere. absolutely huge. Not everyone can afford that. So sometimes having things like a friend who's doing it with \nyou, maybe a partner who supports you, let your wife, girlfriend, whatever know that this is super important to you, be on top of me, track me, work on these things, help me work through this stuff. Beyond that, if you don't have that, if you have friends who lift, hang around the gym. You'll probably find some. But even my app, the standard community, we have the transformation challenge. We have standard plus. We have weekly calls. We have a circle group chat. We have all these chats hanging out in there that people can meet and talk to each other and hang out there as they're working through their goals. And just being around that energy. You are who you surround yourself with. So being around that is super helpful. All right. So a \nPost-Meal Walks \nbig thing that I struggle with cuz I live in Florida, but it I'm when I do it, I feel way better is doing a 10-minute walk after every single meal that you eat. There's two reasons why. a lowers cortisol, helps your digestion, lowers your blood sugar and it's so good for you. They've literally done studies comparing this to metformin and it's had very similar effects. Stan effort efing have been talking about this for like 20 years and they're just doing studies on now proving it. Again, bodybuild is always head of the science. Just saying it. He's also a really smart dude though, so do that. But people who don't want to do cardio, don't want to do all this stuff to be able to just eat and then just go walk around for 10 minutes is not that hard. If you're structuring your day properly, you have time for that and it'll be so much more benefit to your body. And same thing like I was talking about for the cardio. If you don't want to do cardio for an hour or whatever, just getting in more steps in a day is super efficient. So if you're someone who has phone calls in a day or you're listening to a podcast or you just have breaks throughout the day instead of sitting\nthere scrolling your phone or doing nothing or sitting on a couch on the phone or behind your desk on the phone, put your AirPods in, headphones, whatever you got and go walk around the parking lot, walk around the building, whatever it may be, and figure it out. and help you get in much better shape much faster. Talk about this a lot \nDigestive Health \nwhen it comes to a bulk but cutting just as important digest digestion can't say that word either is absolutely huge when it comes to anything optimizing progress for your body when it comes to building muscle or burning fat. So being able to do things like eat food in a conscious state, if you're in a high stress state, eating food, not really chewing, swallowing, like big pieces, that's going to create bad digestion, mess up your gut, not be able to absorb nutrients properly. Again, like I keep talking about, spike your cortisol, hold on fat more, just ruin a lot of things. So having digestive supplements if you need to take a betain HCL before you eat, some gut health products, something that's going to help you digest, digest enzymes, whatever it may be. But even just being off your phone, chewing your food more, being intentional with it, doing those 10 minutes walks after every single meal can help you so much in progressing and moving forward. And just these little tips and things that you can add throughout the day. And the more touch points that you have in the day that are progressing you towards your goal, the more conscious you are of your goal and the more likely you're going to continue to make good decisions. to doing that on top of creating a plan while you're at the beginning of the day or have the beginning of the weekend full of energy and follow that plan when you're tired throughout. You're setting yourself up for success and you're in a much better position than most people. So, at the end of the day, cutting sucks. It can be hard. It can be also be easy when you get to a certain point, but if you want to get shredded, it's not always fun. But if you want to get something, got to go through hard [beep] sometimes. It's just the way it is. If you want to drive results that most people don't get, you have to do things that most people won't do, and it's the way it is. So, all these tips and tricks are something that help and there's so much more I could talk about and even myself now being on a diet and progressing forward in all the YouTube videos to come, I'll keep implementing little tips and tricks and showing you how I'm doing it and adapting what I'm trying, what's worked for me, what doesn't. So, I'll continue to talk about this cuz there's so much more that you can do. But at the end of the day, like I said, create a plan, stick to it, check your food, eat healthy food, and take care of your body because being healthy is what matters. So, have a good reason to do what you're doing, and it will work out better in the end. Yeah, that's my ramble on cutting for the day. So, I hope you guys enjoyed this. If you guys want to see me ramble on other random topics, plan in life, let me know. Like I said, I will continuously be talking about this stuff going forward. So, thank you guys for watching. I'll see you later. \nHere's the second video's transcript on cutting"

Clean Transcript \nSam?s Club haul, snack picks, donations, and a light pull day?(Edited for readability; filler removed, key moments Prepared: Oct 27, 2025 \nIntro at Sam?s Club \n[Music] \n?What is up, YouTube!? Back at Sam?s Club for a quick grocery haul. Easing back into training post?hair procedure; not full sessions yet, but dialing diet back in. Last big shop before the holidays; snacks allowed (not on prep). \nProteins & Mains (why each) \n? Oven?roasted turkey breast ? sandwich staple; stuffs it heavy with meat. \n? Atlantic salmon ? ?fresh fats + omega?3s,? eating 1?2x/day lately; tastes great post?prep. ? Ground bison ? prefers flavor over beef; leans cleaner vs. typical farmed beef. \n? Chicken breast ? boneless, skinless; Courtney nails the pan?fry (aminos help the flavor). ? Beef tenderloin (filet) ? go?to steak cut: lean, tender; cooks beautifully even if ?less \n beefy.? \nVeg & Carbs (go?to prep) \n? Chopped kale kit (uses greens only) ? toss with olive/coconut oil; oven or pan until \n crispy; add to chicken & rice bowls. \n? Clementines ? nostalgic; packs 4?5/day. ?Vitamin C, Florida life.? \n? Sweet potatoes ? peeled, chopped, heavy coconut oil, 350?F roast until crisp (coconut oil  crisps best); burn a little for fry vibe. \n? Frozen veggie medley ? ?lazy stir?fry hack?: microwave 1?2 min, then pan?crisp, add rice &  chicken. \nSnacks & Treats (off?prep picks) \n? Chicken strips (?nuggets but bougier?) ? lighter, crisp breading; dip ideas: honey?mustard  + mayo OR ketchup + sriracha. \n? Peanut?butter pretzel bites ? airport weakness; far cheaper by the tub; decent calories  for a snack. \n? Almond butter (ingredients check) ? prefers just almonds + salt; drizzles on morning \n toast. \n? Passing on: pizza bagels, cereal (?Raisin Bran?), Nutella?for now. ?Bulk coming in the New  Year.? \nSupplements on Shelf \nRaw Nutrition at Sam?s Club ? pre, creatine sold through fast; protein still stocked. Cool moment to see it in big?box retail (and selling out). \nHoliday Giveback Run (same trip) \nGrabs toys/electronics for donations + a simple giveaway (iPad, AirPods, Apple Watch, massage gun, etc.). \nEntry was: like the post + follow RAW (Christmas spirit, thank you to supporters).\nHome/Checkout Bits \n?Empty sack ? full sack.? Banter about bikes, hats, and a Gen?2 Raptor in the lot. Jokes about ?dad flavors? (olives, black licorice, root beer starting to hit). \nLight Pull Day (easing back in) \nPlan: 3?4 sessions/week; push/pull/legs split to re?introduce movement. Notes: \n? Mobility/G.B.R.S. work left hips/obliques lit up?time off made tightness worse. Movement >  no movement. \n? More free weights for stability: barbell rows, one?arm DB rows, pull?ups. Pull?downs don?t  translate 1:1 to pull?ups; wants proficiency at pull?ups. \n? Stability cue on 1?arm DB row: don?t let the hip do the pulling. Protract/retract scap,  keep hip quiet so the back does the work. \n? Pull?ups: first set ?10; short rests drop reps fast. Focus on clean chin?over and  controlled reps. \n? Feeling ?skinny?fat? vanished with a pump?muscle was just ?sleepy.? Goal: maintain,  rebuild smartly. \nFamily & Life \n? Baby update: girl dad incoming; excited + a little scared for teen years. ? Menthol/CBD pain balm helped travel headache/neck tension (?new cologne??). ? CrossFit talk: fun thought experiment; respects the sport, no plans to disrespect athletes  by showing up unprepared. Maybe a local WOD someday; games would take years. ? ?Not sacrificing biceps for kipping.? (Fragile biceps history?lat/biceps tears;  bodybuilding arms stay.) \nWrap?Up \nThat?s a wrap on 2023.

Chest Workout & Coaching Announcement (Transcript) Compiled: 2025-11-01 08:07:32 \nwhat is up YouTube \n[Music] \n[Music] \nforeign \n[Music] \n[Music] \npeople forget like you make decisions and you just like feel it out you live \nyour life and then the world's talking \nabout it like why are you hiding this and it's just like I've just lived in my \nlife you know but yeah so as you guys know video before this I guess will be sadly meaning they're no longer working together but the exciting news is me and honey are working together now the \nprocreator the 20 times the Olympia Champion coach 20 20. \nsoon to be a few more hopefully more yeah oh yeah we've been working together for a few weeks we I mean we \nstarted talking in August officially and I kind of shocked him a little bit he \ndidn't know I would want I \nwas like talking briefly like maybe we could like help me a little bit like this \nand that and then I called him I was like so how do you feel about \ncoaching me he's like a [ __ ] coach coach like everything I'm like yeah he's like [ __ ] man at the last minute it was \ndefinitely from Left Field a lot of people think this thing's been going on for a long time it actually hasn't a lot \nof it had to do with the fact that when we started talking originally I think it \nwas the Arnold we were just the first \ntime we were just you know conversing but later on it was more about just hey what are your different techniques regarding you know mental mindset and some of those other things and \neventually there were some videos that were made regarding us working together when we weren't working together and the \nonly thing that came about that was the conversation of eventually men working together it actually started the \nconversation it wasn't what was actually happening which is really funny I have the text of her it's my text message hey \nTony hey it's Chris it's my number the next one what the [ __ ] is this video man you text me the question mark question \nmark what's this video like people saying we're coaching and I'm like [ __ ] like let me call you in a second and I called them and I was like well like you know I've been like we've talked about you helping me with my [ __ ] and you know somehow we got out there whatever and then it would blew up and I was like so \nwhat do you think I was like oh you're serious \nbe pretty cool and he said no no no let's think about doing the whole prep and then obviously it was a very big \ndecision because it was came from Left Field because I I've never somebody who's\nan actual somebody who's actually \nbeen winning the Olympia in the past when I worked with other athletes it was somebody that had started with me or had \nended up winning the Olympia with me or had come back after losing the Olympia uh 2009 Jay Cutler \num but it wasn't obviously it's a lot of pressure but it was also from left field so there was a lot of conversations back \nand forth on how that would work but uh obviously as I got to know Chris and be able to talk to him many many hours on \nthe phone FaceTime all those things being able to understand kind of what the process is what his process is I \nfelt like it was a it was going to be something or I could definitely help sure yeah I mean I don't think you were \ntoo fond that it was 16 weeks out or what whatever it was yeah because he says like I only work \nwith people and have a full year of off-season learning your body getting where I want and then we start prep and I'm just starting prep like this so but we're gonna make it work you know yeah I thought my first rodeo it's not your first rodeo so a little challenge too \nbut we'll make it work yes I'm excited you know like you guys know me I'm very laid back I'm pretty like loose like just try and chill take what I can Honey's very like everything's got to be perfect like what's this going on what's this what's this what's this very like \nmeticulous and I think the combination of those two things of him like filling the gaps where I might like Overlook because I'm just like do my [ __ ] and he's like on it for me I think that's gonna flow together really well you know what I'm told to do I do is 100 and he's \ngonna tell me what to do and then we're gonna [ __ ] do it so excited yeah and you're not used to being told what to do \na little bit but not fully new everybody laughs at that our house Courtney Calvin are like oh my God someone telling what \nto do I'm like is that that rare for me but I guess so so I know I can hear it though and it'll be exciting to try \nsomething you knew you know obviously we've spoken we're not changing the wheel no you know I mean obviously he's \none it's the thing but there's a lot of Young and Hungry guys coming after you want to really try to make some improvements and like you said ideally I'd like to live to start working together in January or February but um it just it stars aligned right now and \nthis is what we want to do because we want to be able to try to bring in the best version of Chris possible and just \nget in there and try to combine the formulas and be able to take it to the next level forever Improvement yeah yeah \nyeah I mean it's been good so far you know not a huge change of stuff you got some fst7 sets we add in little things \nbut overall training is similar it's intense keep your strengths at the beginning of prep like I always do I \nstill get to do my heavy squats my heavy presses all that [ __ ] with the little\ntweaks on the end so yeah it's been good so far and I know we'll be going forward \nso yeah yeah I'm gonna [ __ ] [ __ ] up four-time Olympia coming up soon that's it brother all right now it's chest day \nso we got to get to work we'll show you how we work right now so stay tuned so let's start start with the incline let's \nget you warmed up there see how you feel and then if everything feels really good we'll start moving \nstuff done early and then we can use some fs7 stuff again but let's just really make sure that you have the \nability to be able to do that everything so we can build that base to keep it stronger yeah \nso did you start a heavy dumbbells start there and there after you're warmed up and we do a good working set two working \nsets there then we're going up here all right [Music] \nhave you used this machine before no okay you just got it like I was looking for one myself \nthe actual start oh maybe a little bit yeah \n[Music] \nhalf inch one's actually okay \njust go a little lighter you're still kind of a little narrow yeah it's good for warm-up but as we get into heavier \nsets it should go a little wider and you know you have to wait it seems like you would \nbe amazing but you want my elbows play up here or more like lower not out just right there right here \n[Music] \nyou'll have a little \nright come on Chris got it good \ndon't go again all the way up push push press push fire \nhigher higher oh good slow good job [Music] \nthe heavy machine it's a good movement though yeah as \nyou're arching and you're driving it's perfect just make sure you keep your chin up so you can just make sure you get a little extra on the very end because sometimes you're gonna have to catch yourself not being able to extend all the way chin down because you feel \nlike your chest is flexed all the way it really is it yeah a little further up I feel like I'm flexing harder when I do this you know because I'm like pushing it all the subconscious then I'll just \ngo here right now a little bit \nslowly number three two one \nthere you go come on \ncome on \ngood partial three three one two one \nmore \nheavy it is heavy yeah ain't no Hammer strikes \nyep it's all Flex machine is very heavy so if you never use a support it definitely it literally feels like three plates if not more in a way so I feel\nlike it's almost three place when you're using it or do you feel like like you're mentioned three please yeah yeah a lot \n140s one I think 140 would be good because you just did six and it felt okay but you're a little tired from last \nnight's right now yeah so I think like if we're going to be pushing into that set range about eight to ten I don't think you're going to be able to if you feel 150 is solid or if you feel like \nwhen I first exercised on a good day start with 150 I get 10. okay so after that you just went over that first exercise too \nright \nfor the light [Music] \nseconds go go go \none more \nperfect symmetry yesterday we do rows 140s press 140s balances here you probably don't have a weak back it's all about the balance yeah same way let's go \nwhat on the way let's go \nwith me \n[Music] I feel so good controlled but hard \nbefore that so let's move into a power press while \nwe're still on the incline mom's new show do you want to go with that wedding kind uh \nno I want to keep it gear I want to work on that upper see how that goes I've been doing this every chest and they \nfeel good but it's just different for me the way I have the long arms it's hard for me to tuck like when I'm pressing \npeople out with a girl but it's so flared but like my arms are just so long so when I do this actually you need to stay gloves it's a good mix I guess yeah if you get some good flexion yeah you're keeping your shoulders and back and your chest out it's just arch your back and \nthen just drive this prep yeah because I think that other spot is just gonna be good good chin up okay they're good there you go come on \nChris \n[Music] good looking out go \npush push it together together good job good \nnot bad don't feel better a little more speed though yeah \nsolid definitely got a good range of motion on it too fast \nthis is all about like a foundation set that you're going to be able to use as much weight as possible within reason \nwithout getting hurt but keeping it in that eight to ten range but work your way up to it but this is going to be one \nof those things where we're not going to be doing like I don't want to do any just really get up to that point where \nyou hit that 8-10 then you feel like it's too late so \nwe're here \nwithout six and see if that's still warming up \ngoing out the working set and making sure \n[Music]\n[Music] \ngo go come on \nslow slow slow [Music] \nwe're doing the tricks there one more one more one more I still know how to count \npays off [ __ ] they're counting over and I don't understand one thing I was excited about when we \nstarted working together I think a lot of people misconstrue what fsd7 is and they just think you're a huge volume guy and people like Chris you don't train like that at all blah blah I was like it's not how he trains not everything is seven sets of 20 and like killing it's like still the foundation same as always muscle requires strength to hold on to \nwhen you're prepping you're eating less you need to be strong to hold on to that muscle so like it's still listening \nheavy if not heavier than I've always trained at this point in prep and then you throw in some volume at the end or \nthe beginning if you need it right and as you do at the end but it's still getting strong and with some heavy weight same [ __ ] it's a little harder at the end yep just making sure you manipulate both \ntypes of fibers because you need to be able to be stronger so you can handle heavier weights so that even when you're \ndoing high volume you use heavier weight on high volume a lot of people think that it's just seven sets for two or \nthree exercises and that's it and you go lighter it's not how it works if they wish it'd be nice if you get used that \nwouldn't even be fun actually no one wants that gotta earn it \nthe picture good \ncome on slow I need slower negative I need so \nI'm going to help with the positive that's why it looks so easy come on together now slow hold it hold it there hold it hold it come on Chris work on the East Center come on slow slow one more one more come on let's go finish strong slow \ngood and release good job \nit's beautiful I love it there you go \nI feel ashamed Connie told me I had to shave my legs because my legs are so [ __ ] hair you can't tell how lean \nthey are I never shave my legs until like four weeks out last minute unless you're leaving to shave my calves so I'm \nlike a Hobb it up to my knee it might be a new look see if I can get this trending I guarantee you you can't \nI hope not \ngood \none more good warm-up sets are open \nthis is the goat test machine do you have it find it take all the stress out of bicep forearms everything it just \nsqueezes from the elbow which feels great hard to find though yeah very hard to find one of my favorite machines I \nused to use this back when I was competing really helps with getting that really\ngreat contraction without having \nyour arms kick in like Chris said and what you want to do is you want to make sure that I like to go in over and under \njust so that you don't end up just using one side as a dominant side so every rep switch \n[Applause] nice come on \nkeep going keep going go go [Music] \ngood go go come on Chris come on you got this \nyou got this three-part let's go one one two two \nthat's it \nwe have worked long the long work the other long enough for me to know what he looks

in the Carbone area yeah right through there that made some improvements the \nlast couple weeks and um trying to jam in as much as you can in terms of these types of different \nvariations and these exercises to get those muscles to grow those muscular just I just want to see \nwhat that looks like on you chest up yeah there you go \n10 weeks out today so it's out today \nthank you \nthere you go

\nforeign \nforeign \nfor a few days trying to get shredded trying to get huge fine-tuning everything make sure everything's right \non point where we want it to be for the rest of the prep 10 weeks out today so getting close but yeah I mean new coach \nthis year not a whole lot of variables crazy things are going to change I think he's pretty basic and he pretty like \njust persistent on Little Things fine-tuning them everything you need to do is level yourself up getting better \nhe always says one percent one percent one percent one percent adds up slowly and gets you to be 10 20 better which \nadds up slowly even a few percentage at my level is a big change so it's exactly what I'm trying to do right now just \nfine tune all the little things for those of you who don't know honey maybe\nsomething because they're young or not in the bodybuilding World he's coached some absolutely amazing people and does some creative things with them from Phil Heath Jay Cutler Seth roasty coaching \nDerek Lunsford right now hottie children a whole bunch of people very successful and honestly I never thought that I \nwould ever want him to coach me I never was like he's good good he's had success he's worked with other people who are good who you know I never were like oh he's who I want I always respected what he had done obviously because he'd been very good but I never wanted anyone other than e and The Coachman I never even thought outside of that because it's just we were with an Olympians why would I change you know but circumstances presented itself or we needed to change and I met Hani and she kind of like lined up perfectly right when I was thinking we coached me I met \nhim and I spoke with him and I was like [ __ ] I just like connected with what he was saying I saw how passionate he was and how intense he was about winning and \nobsessed he wasn't winning and like being the best version that you can be for yourself beating yourself the year \nbefore all the way we spoke and communicate about his mindset and the way he handles stress and kind of has worked with competitors at a high level winning multiple championships which people don't understand the level of like mentality that comes into like \nwinning again and again and again and keeping not getting comfortable not letting your foot off the gas and kind \nof keep pushing harder because people are getting better and better especially when you set up new standard they're reaching that new standard getting better so you keep setting a new standard every year and he knows how to do that so you know when we spoke and I \nkind of connected with someone like [ __ ] this just felt right the timing was perfect and I kind of kept it inside me for like six months since we're back at the Arnold I think when we first spoke and I didn't speak to him didn't say anything I was just like that could be interesting you know maybe and here we are so I'm excited it's been great so far I feel like I'm in a very good spot at this point and I'm fired up I'm \nmotivated I just feel excited for this Olympia prep right now I'm feeling good so shit's gonna be good very good very \nexciting we'll keep you along for the ride but yeah that's about it that's all that's going on to get some food to me because I was starving after that workout got legs tomorrow gonna kill myself and then he's gonna fly out tomorrow wrap it up and back to regular \nscheduled programming so thank you guys for watching catch you in the next one Generated for Gym project ? single-PDF transcript compilation."
