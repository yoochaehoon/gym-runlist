she has to announce that all right so that's a wrap on today's workout moving to the open just kidding \na good workout grateful to be training out with some of the short Kings of the industry you didn't hear me yeah well I'm literally those that's less than dirt people you say so much \nmore people better watch it short Kings you want to \nlose a bunch of weight and come to Classic I don't think you're gonna ever make way like you said when we  retire we'll just \nswitch divisions but yeah so we're hungry because we've \nbeen standing for too long so we're gonna go search find some food we'll see you later [Music] \nthank you [Music] \nokay [Music] \nit's funny I don't get to introduce people that often that create the \nresponse that this guy creates when I walk back there wherever I see a long line I always say when you see a  long \nline well you know what that means you know it means that somebody in particular is at the head of IT these  days because it's turned out where he \nhas become such a great Ambassador for the sport for the industry and I know a \nlot of you guys are here to see him to meet him to get to take a photograph with him if you're so fortunate to  take \na selfie with him because that means if you post it on your social media you then will become a big deal so it is my great privilege to welcome the reigning champion of the classic \nphysique Olympia division one of the all-time greats one of the greatest to ever do it please welcome Stevo [Applause] \nall right what is up Pittsburgh you know what's funny if you guys know me I still \nget anxious to tell a public speaking talking in front of people but when Jim presented me with the  opportunity to either come up and talk in front of a \ncrowd or take my clothes off and pose with some students backstage right now well here I am I'm standing here  with \nthe mic so also it's pretty hilarious my mom called me and every time she got these shows if she sees these  guys she's \nlike Christopher are you gonna get big of these guys and I'm like Mom would you \nbut with that being said that's what you guys are unfortunate you guys are an absolute Retreat it's very rare  that you \nguys get on stage let alone together and they may not be in the best shape of their life but I can guarantee  you they're probably the biggest and then \nequally as expensive to see and something that's probably even more rare to see so if you guys are fans of  bodybuilding together for a helmetry if \nyou're watching the amateur show the pro show if you have aspirations to step on the stage one day this is the  show to be at right now this is full of just \nmotivation and inspiration so I hope you guys are all enjoying it enjoying the show I want to give a quick  thanks to the Manus minions for showing for \nputting on the show every year it's a beautiful show they give back to the city of Pittsburgh and they're  bringing up absolutely crazy Talent put on a show\nfor you guys so big can of Applause for the minions and beautiful show they put on \n[Music] foreign \nshow thank you [Applause] \nthank you we can't let them off the stage this easier man me and Dan came up with this business together with something called PBW which is probably doing weekly many many years ago so we cut our  team \ninterviewing guys just like you Chris and of course we can't let you out thank you to my friend got a few  choice \nquestions I know you said you're going for number five we had some good Builders along I give it a little bit  of a run but sebum's just been killing it \nman right I gotta asked the golden question Chris nobody ever asked Chris this question the classic physique division was put in not that long ago brand new what would you have done in your career or would you have had  a \ncareer if there was no classic physique division 2016 Metro is an open body builder in \nheavyweight and heavy weight not a super heavyweight at six foot one I'm probably one of the smallest guys on  stage I know \na lot of these judges where they judge me so thank you for that bro kind I appreciate it but I honestly was  ready \nto be done I did have a I didn't think I had a future an open minded living it wasn't something for me so it's  probably \nevery single year every day when I'm sitting on stage I'm so grateful for the classic media The Division I  think it's \nopened up such a bigger variety of scope of people to watch the sport and kind of \ncome into it it's a much more Modern Age thing and then we have all the divisions kind of checked out we got  the big Mass \nMonsters the shorter Math Monsters and the classic Adventures you've got everything something for everybody so  I'm very grateful that it's something \nfor me it's skyrocketed the joy and beauty of my life and everything I get to enjoy every day so [Music] the landscape would have been if this \ndivision doesn't exist t-bomb doesn't exist at least in the terms we know now he's amassed a huge follower you know it's fun watching the divisions uh come alive and when you think about it if there was no 212  divisions we \nmight not know the name Flex Lewis right if there was no classic physique division we might not know the name  Chris Homestead and you guys are in fact \na couple of the biggest stars in the world but the one question that I know you must get asked a lot is  talking \nabout whether or not you want to make the transition into the open Division I know that's something you have  to hear a \nlot so for the benefit of the thousands here and the millions watching around the world what are some of the  things \nthat go through your mind when that question is presented as you evaluate that possibility I don't know if  it's so \nmuch what goes through my mind but social school goes through my mind I see people like my brother and IEM I  see \npeople backstage looking at Walker big room and I'm like oh [ __ ] [Music] \nand honestly the first thing that pops in my head is I'm just so grateful to be where I'm at you know like I  said \nPlastics is he just giving me a beautiful life and so many moments that I will never forget every time I see these lights and do it reminds me to Olympia stage and I'm like it's given me so many moments and so many  experiences \nand brought so many people in my life that I can never think of living here right now so I'm just enjoying  where I'm at increasing enjoying the journey where \nI've had problems okay give it up [Applause] \nbefore I die that's not to say that people ask me all the time what is it about Chris mom said what's the fascination why are people so wrapped up in your life and your story and the way\npeople respond to you it's it's without a rival and I always say I sum it up in one simple word and this is  something \nthat if you're out there and you are aspiring Fitness celebrity or bodybuilder or somebody who is trying to connect with fans I will sum up Chris's Secret in one word and it is \nauthenticity there is perhaps no one who puts themselves out there exactly has as they are the way that you do Chris and for that we salute you and thank you \nAdvance on \nsolving no that didn't make sense \n[Music] \nit's dramatic intro \nall right so that's going to be wrapped on Pittsburgh got the train with Seth got the train with Derek it's a  good \nworkout got to meet a lot of people very grateful for it not grateful I had to go up on stage and talk I am  but I go up \nand down in my ability to speak last when I did Miami did a great job this time I trashed it the heart started  racing I got nervous I was like [ __ ] I \ndon't know what I'm saying and I just lost it but it is what it is you know maybe one day I'll be good at  public speaking but you think that the amount \nof time I've been on stage would get better but I'm nervous as hell every single time so it is what it is  welcome to the life of sebum I guess it'll never \nchange but I guess I just got to keep doing it until I get better because that's the only way to do it but  that \nbeing said I appreciate you guys watching back to Florida for a few days and then we're going off to Italy on  a nice little trip so hopefully me and \nCalvin can get like two videos or so this week so there's no gap of content like crazy when I'm traveling but  there \nprobably will be so forgive us for that thank you guys for watching appreciate you guys and I'll see you guys  next time"

    "text": "CBum Back Day with Brett Wilkin Transcript Generated on 2025-11-06 \nall right kids welcome back to working \nout with c but i'm finally getting a \ngood workout for you guys i'm training \nwith mr brett welcome today so i'll \nintro him when i see him at the gym you \nguys probably already know who he is \nobviously but i have very exciting news \nrocket candy \nhas finally come back in stock along \nwith blackberry lemonade dropping if \nthis video goes up on monday \nmay 11 \napril april whatever [ __ ] month it is \nright now april 11th 12 p.m at 12 p.m we \nare restocking that we also have peach \nt-e-a-a new t-shirts that are really \ndope t-shirts if they're pictures i'll \nhave scott put them up and a bunch of \nother stuff i'll talk about it on the \ngram but i'm throwing down two scoops of \nthis because i'm training with a large \nman an open bodybuilder and i'm trying \nto get \nsavage af so \ntaking two scoops of this by the way if \nyou guys don't already know it is meant \nto be two cubes serving but we just have \na scoop like this in case you want to \nmix it up so some days i do one scoop or \nyou can do two scoops but we're finally \nback in stock with these flavors i \nhaven't even had rock candy myself for a \nwhile so i'm excited to finally have it \nback in my arsenal i like having the \narray of flavors to pick from switch it \nup but i'm going to throw this down get \nto the gym because that's probably \nwaiting for me so i'm always late for \neverything story of my life but i'll see \nyou guys there \npeace out \n[Music] \nwhat is up youtube welcome back to a \nworkout vlog it's been a while since i \nhad a big workout video but mr brett \nwilkin aka the butcher is in town so \nwe're gonna be getting some back today \nhe wanted me to run the workout but the \nrule is the smaller kid has to follow\nthe workout he i used to be a little bigger than him and now he's a lot bigger than me so the roles have reversed he's gonna be showing me how to build a big back but this is i mean we've already introduced him on the raw podcast that we posted on instagram and everything but our newest wrong athlete another mr brett wilkin he probably was one of the \nbiggest outburst athletes of last year in the pro league so we're super honored to have him on the team he's a good dude as well known him for like five years and heard nothing but good things about him so we thought we'd bring him on the team maybe move him down to florida if we're lucky enough to have him but other than that we're just gonna be heading back today trying to huge having some fun so hope you guys enjoy \nyep hold it hold it right there \ngood \nelbow \nyes \ngood \nall right \noh \n[Music] \nall the way down \n[Music] \nperfect \nyep \n[Music] \nyes \n[Music] \nwe have to do this one first because my hands get so wet here from the humidity that i won't be able to grip that it's hot \nall right so we're starting this workout with some pull downs with the prime handle here \nit's nice using this because you can actually rotate within it so you can stretch and rotate your elbows in on the way down \nthe only thing that's really hard to hold so when you get over like 10 plus reps my brachialis just starts to burn the horrible forearms but probably a good thing so starting off with this stretch it a little bit warm up and then move on to some rows or something he's running the workout\ncome on yes \nperfect \nsqueeze yes \n[Music] \nyes stay forward stay forward drive through you good \nstep drive pass drive fast \nyes \n[Music] \noh \n[Music] \ngood \n[Music] \nhere we go come on \n[Music] \n[Music] \nyes \noh come on \ngood \nhow do you feel what how do you feel good yeah \nthese machines are all very lovely on back there i don't always love prime but that like \nrotation you can get in your wrist will really lock your elbows in personally helps me a lot on the chest supported rows so the few prime attachment we've been using feel really good \ni really focus now on my back like through at least three of the exercises i actually hold each rep in the \ncontraction so i squeeze my back like i'm hitting a pose on stage and then i let it go and that really helps me with my mind muscle connection so \nnot as it can go heavy but it helps [Music] \ncome on \ncome on \nyep \nknocked the window to me i lost my breath on like the fourth one i was like gasping for air \num \nall right just in here \n[Music] \n[Music] \n[Music] \n[Music] \ncome on \nperfect \ni honestly think raw \nyou guys should make here \nthat's the size this is like\nmy favorite ever they're so easy you know \nwhat's that it's just a small cup of egg right yeah but they're not eight it's like half an hour so it is just here it's a quick wrap and that's it \n[Music] \n[Music] \noh \n[Music] \noh \nholy [ __ ] \n[Music] \nyep \n[Music] \nhere we go \ngood \nyep \nyes \n[Music] \nhere we go \nhere we go \nall right so that's a wrap on today's back workout did a pretty successful training session as always we keep the volume decently low and we do like one or two working sets but it's all you need we're gas by the end and you can't even pull anymore because we're actually putting the work into each set so it's good training with mr brett over here fourth workout probably of many if you move down here but probably my whole career i've traded with people bigger than me so it's just like in my mind that i'm usually the smallest guy in the gym so it's always good to have bigger guys coming in kind of make you strive for more even though i'm in classics there's always room for improvement always room to grow even if i'm close to my weight caps so good training session i'm gonna head home grab some food and maybe wrap up the video there i'm not really sure what we're doing but thank you guys for tuning in and \nyour youtube channel brett the butcher the butcher welcome brett the butcher welcome check it out we're going to

that'll be it for \nme but yeah we got Ian back here we just \ndid a \npodcast he's talked about his [ __ ] \nretirement a million times so we're not \ngoing to beat the dead horse but jabed \non for an hour and a half listen that \nwe're back into the world so he's going \nto be doing a lot of cool [ __ ] on \nYouTube that's the what we're talking \nabout a lot of a living life after \nbodybuilding so stay tuned to that but \ntoday we're bodybuilding because I'm \nstill 5 weeks out so we're getting in a \nnice little back workout I feel like I\nneed crops now they look have you ever worn them no what size your you're these are 12 I'm like a 13 just click this is it toe base wide enough oh it's huge yeah it's great that's all I care \nabout Cory will not be happy if I start like that's a little small for you but oh they're good right oh yeah yeah once you wear them and like I honestly I just wear them in the house I wear them everywhere now yeah all I care about is being able to spread my toes yeah so if you go one size bigger so you got room but if you put them in sport mode like this put that down man [ __ ] feels good ready to run I'm ready to run beautiful but yeah what's going on so stay tuned we're going to be doing a back workout there's a few things I got to do maybe I'll tell Ian to tell me what to do at the end of the workout and we're just going to make the most of it so stay tuned let's do it I can tell my one cap has a little more like nerve issues than the other so like what feels tight on one leg and what feels tight on the other is like completely different it's probably more than just that probably all your hip this one like doing it with a bent leg so like I guess more that more Solus is like way tighter where this one stretching with the straight leg like getting more into the gas rock is like way more tight you know my whole left leg is like crank out and tight \nyeah \nwhat are you doing with give us a rundown what's your like back what have you been doing back [ __ ] random like working sets like exercises what are we looking for here I do like two working sets one of them is often like a drop set or something yeah if I don't and it feels good I'll do three but typically two working sets six exercises to warm it up with a pullover and then I've been trying to do V \noverose the capacity I can sure so [ __ ] up in the machines yeah Co but is this heavy nothing new no but I know how \nworkouts how are you are you actually like pushing like I said you just like like what I've been doing what I was\ndoing for the first little while is like opposing super sets and I would make like a circuit of four exercises so say if I would do like flat bench with a bent over like two arm dumbbell row and then I would do like a dip and a pullup and do like all four with like no break and then take like 2 minutes and do it again so I I keep my heart rate up so like by the end of that I would make it so that by like if I would say do three or four rounds of that by like the end of it I was getting the sets like just a soft failure now what I've been doing cus I'm trying to reduce like I don't need to be doing like reps like that so I'm doing like 5x5 bench 5x5 standing overhead press and then if I do some like accessory work I don't know what the [ __ ] people call in this world now I'll do like yeah my dips my pull-ups it's like 80 90% 80% yeah like rp8 so like it feels good and I'm getting a pump but I'm not pushing things to like crazy to you know but like man doing flat bench I was doing like 5x5 flat bench but so next to you you know great yeah push weight but not like kill yourself in set no put on put like you know three plates in the 10 to five or three and a qu you know so it's like good but not like challenging to that that extent still like my [ __ ] one rep max I mean to be honest I couldn't probably do 10 reps with that before that was like a rep I can probably do 15 to 18 with 65 you know but yeah I'm trying to back down down like the actual reps in sets you know like I'm not trying to do anything like 10 12 reps you're not trying to like increase stress cortisol response and like recovery I'm not trying to get like a crazy pump where I think I'm like doing hypert work you know \nyeah \noh \noh \ngoing do \nit just said you \ndon't when in Ram you \nknow stairs here yeah in this am I in this weather oh that's \nrough you acclimate pretty well yeah like I've been training you for two like\ntwo months not even I mean even then like when we're going out and riding on the track we're outside yeah you know it be 25? r run for 2 hours like here than into out side Canada though yeah for sure especially we're running at 600 p.m. so you \nknow I would love to train here at like 700 p.m. but I'm practically in bed by that yeah got to go when you feel best here \nup \nni \nthere one \nmore and if anyone has any tricks for debilitating headaches please help I get horrible headaches all the time they're killing me but we started with pullovers today I love that nless pullover machine really helps like open up my my lats and just like WG my body up get my back firing a little bit I'm me neglecting like spinal loaded like erector loaded rows been doing a lot of chest support [ __ ] so starting off with that today not going pretty heavy trying to like control the first five or six reps lock in on the squeeze and just really focusing on squeezing up pulling into my hips my lower lats and then I'm going to do one or two sets reverse grip to even hit more lower lat hopefully my wrist can handle it and then Ian's got his Crocs off so getting \nserious \n[Music] \ne \n30 40 \nmore \ndone with this yeah \ncome on J let's \ngo \nyou do three \nhere \ndown there you \ngo that's \ngood \ngood \nyeah \n2700 calories like low but not too bad not it's defin definitely good lower yeah \nthat's not bad I can Thrive off this yeah once I go out under yeah yeah 2500 ish is\nmanageable if I plateaued for like Weight Wise Weight Wise like 3 weeks almost is it starting to move now no no got leaner though so you're getting leaner that's all that matters right now yeah until I'm like 4 weeks out I'm not going to worry about my weight I mean you're in good shape for 6 weeks I wouldn't be worried definitely look bigger than last week sure \nmaybe it's cuz I'm getting skinny too work out in a gym like this you just like when you get sick PPKs from the heat too like like you know how I never used to eat salt mhm I like have salt like you know yeah and I sweat so much here I just like so You' been having normal salt now fine [ __ ] like yeah like that's good I have pancakes in the morning I I have put layers of them and I cover them in [ __ ] Sol like that make a huge difference for your fullness ability sweat and stuff cuz remember you were like you couldn't even sweat no you know nothing I still don't sweat a lot but and your kidneys tolerated fine y good great the stem cells actually help yeah you did IV ones too right yeah didn't do the renal one eh he did no but he did I I he did IV but there's one where they actually put it into the renal there yeah not the kidney the renal artery okay so it all goes into your kidneys cu puncturing he said even got tangible difference from just doing IV exactly yeah yeah so I might do the Reno one when Dubai \nyeah \nback \nall right let's go this helps bit big breath let's \ngo \ngood \nyeah one \nmore all right let's go Crank It \nUp come \non \nw \n[Music] \nah \nyeah \nd \nlook \n[Music] \nmen's physique this year men's you was\njust saying men's physique weight cut offs are what my weight cut off was last year so might as well just hop into men's physique this year and switch it all up I've been training abs for like 5 weeks so who knows maybe maybe I'll be able to do it cash me in the board shorts \n2023 I'll do \none \nlike I'm eating probably eating similar yeah but I'm look yeah your output probably like CU you're doing cardio every day and training how much cardio are you doing though but I'm not doing cardio weights on the same days but your cardio was like real cardio it'll be like an hour of spin not like yeah hour spin where I'm like in my heart like 160 like going hard I'm doing like 110 120 yeah and I'll do an hour or hour and 10 three times a week plus 2 hours a week of the track so I guess two \nfour 7 hours of cardio week \napproximately 6 to seven yeah I mean output with was is more intense yes but you still have muscle especially with like burning muscle glycogen and stuff and like really bring your energy \nreserves down how doing twice a week I'm do like [ __ ] five exercises in like 75% yeah get the central nervous system it's not the nervous system is probably more of it \n[Music] \ne \nall right so I switched my split up a little bit so maybe in my next video I'm going to explain what my split is as we're getting into the prep series to start explaining everything I'm doing but I do arms after back now where before used to be more spread out so instead of doing back and buys I just focus on a full complete back workout and then I have arms tomorrow so because of that I added in rear delts onto back there CU you're already hitting them a little bit so I just hit one or two \nspecific rear delt movements just to help tap off my shoulders get a little trap in there too so me and tan up some bicep probably first time training arms in a month finish with some routs and then call it a\nday \nd \nthey my \nback they're definitely get a little smaller they are nearly as full huh they yeah the fullness not yeah \nyou're [ __ ] treaded though \nyeah it's like me one week \nout \nliterally I'm going to kill myself for the next [ __ ] six weeks just to try to look like that yeah but I did it at the complete expense of muscle where \nthat's like the opposite of bodybuilding you know but it was like weird \nbecause like say you're \nstarting a journey to like downside I didn't have any body fat when I started that Journey like I was 12 weeks 10 weeks out from the Olympia just on Toronto I was only like 12 15 lbs up from stage weight so I was like 8 9% body F so it's like where do you go other than to lose body bat and bit of muscle so first it was like a big drop in fullness and water and I looked really small at first the initial drop I looked smaller than I do now and then it kind of like leveled out when my body got used to how much food was coming in how much like output was and then I felt a little Fuller and then I just started to get leaner you know well you got to the amount of muscle you could hold on easily and then the glycogen could fill that up and sit in there \nyeah would you say the way you're training is like what you would let's say you didn't want to run track but you wanted to downsize a bit and you wanted your joints to be like just really say you want [ __ ] snowboard and I would do the circuits like I was doing it first I would do like chest and back opposing you know bicep tricep opposing kind of stuff like that and just doing like four or five exercises in a row like what I was doing i' be like knee and Ankle stability and like [ __ ] would do maybe a little bit but probably not I mean depends what I want to do like if I'm like want to play like men's league basketball I would have to yeah for sure I'd be getting on like the [ __ ] Topsy turby ankle [ __ ] you know yeah\nespecially snowboarding it's like hey I want to go [ __ ] hike Mount kjaro I probably need to do some [ __ ] like that you know like that's what my bu get L I want to do uh like some crazy Mountain yeah like Everest Bas Camp 2 not the top I get I get at least once a year I get like a very gripping obsession with doing those things I get like down like a rapit hole of like two months where I'm watching all the documentaries on all the 8,000 meter Peaks you know like all those [ __ ] on like crazy doing that would they yeah slow I'm not sure I'm just worried about my ears I think because like you stay at base camp for a little bit and you like takes you 2 weeks to even hike to base camp and there's like an \nacclamation skydiving holy [ __ ] that cuz you're coming out from what 10,000 ft 30,000 ft and it just ears of Pop I was like bleeding and you've always had issues with that too \nlike there when I went to the hospital remember when we jumped off \nthe the [ __ ] diving boards at the pool at the pool you went down the pool yeah I remember that \nall right so it's going to be a wrap on today's back \nworkout I'm losing my mind I thought i' trained biceps today but I just \nliterally said that tomorrow's arm day but had a good little back day with Ian this is probably the last time you'll be stronger than me until I \nretire yeah for a lot of things for sure maybe I can keep a little something something but bench you'll always be be able to bench more of me impress maybe not we're probably like pretty close right now cuz that's like one of the things that comes down first when you lose weight not bar you're \ndefinitely stronger dumbbell yeah I'm probably probably pretty even but I can't bar [ __ ] yeah but no we had a a nice little workout some [ __ ] that kind of been aching in pain on me felt pretty good today so happy with that how do you find working out in a an air conditioned gym in Florida it was good I mean it's honestly if there was any time for me to do it it's when I'm like down a little\nin weight and my cardio is getting a little better you know so it's like I definitely sweat but it was a good sweat and like I'm used to sweating like that now from like doing more cardio output um if your Peak off Seas be yeah if I was 300 lbs that would be [ __ ] brutal like I've done that few yeah I'd be revive for a moment I was like are we going to am I going to have to go to revive but I'm like no he's getting we can do it so it was it was good it's nice you I mean it definitely hits different like your pumps and just like everything feels kind of like a little better you warm up quicker it feels nice so in the gyms great so it was good to good to check it out and get a good workout in yeah so we might get another workout before we leave I don't know we'll see but he's training with the track coach tomorrow and he's going to document that so that'll be cool as you guys know he's [ __ ] transitioning to track star so if you guys want to check out that Journey I'm I'm probably watching that cuz I was even asking about like just knee and rehab and [ __ ] so I'm curious but wrapped up that video going to chill [ __ ] buy some guns this week shoot some [ __ ] and [ __ ] get some massages sleeping train some arms and have a grand old time so thank you guys for watching and I'll catch you in the next one"

lot of area we got to still actually not that much area but we squeeze everything in but we got a lot of more machines coming in and um so shout out to Pata shout out to Primo Fitness for helping us make this dream achievable been working on this for a very long time and um it's been great because of the vast variety of machines and being able to use not only the biomechanics to really help you create that better contraction but also being able to adjust for \ndifferent heights and I mean we have my wife was here works on her uh you got somebody as tall as Chris being able to work on him and everything in between so that's what's really great about it so many different machines that work so well so uh great thing about it is that Chris is going to be here for a couple more days we're going to be working on legs we're going to be working on arms we're going to be working on uh back we're going to be working on shoulders so we got a bunch of different uh workouts coming um but I
